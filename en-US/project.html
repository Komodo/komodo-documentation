  <p>Komodo projects are containers for files, <a href=
  "folders.html">folders</a>, <a href=
  "templates.html">templates</a>, <a href=
  "macros.html">macros</a>, <a href=
  "run.html">run commands</a>, <a href=
  "snippets.html">snippets</a> and links specific to a
  particular software project or website. There are two types of
  Komodo projects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a name="live_projects" id="live_projects">Live
    Projects</a></strong>: A live project does a <a href=
    "#Live_Import">Live Import</a> of the directory where the
    project is created, thereby including all the files and
    sub-directories of that directory. This becomes the live
    project's base directory. Changes in the filesystem are
    reflected in the project, and deleting files from the project
    gives you the option to delete them from the filesystem (the
    "Move to Trash" option). This kind of project is essentially a
    top-level <a href="folders.html">live
    folder</a>.</li>

    <li><strong><a name="static_projects" id=
    "static_projects">Static Projects</a></strong>: Static projects
    are virtual containers for project components, similar to
    <a href="folders.html">virtual folders</a>. They
    can, however, contain live folders.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By default, new Komodo projects are "live". This can be
  changed with the <a href="#Live_Import">Live Import</a>
  preference.</p>

  <p>Komodo projects are XML files stored on disk with a ".kpf"
  extension. If you manually edit the project file, make a backup
  copy first; invalid project files will not load.</p>

  <p>Components can be dragged and dropped between projects and the
  Toolbox. Context menus are available for the various components
  and a Project drop-down menu. New items can be added via the
  <strong>Add item</strong> drop-down menu in the project tab's
  toolbar.</p>

  <h2><a name="project_display" id="project_display">Displaying the
  Projects Sidebar</a></h2>

  <p>The Project sidebar is displayed in the <a href=
  "workspace.html#Left_Pane">left pane</a> of the Komodo
  workspace. It is displayed or hidden via:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>View|Tabs &amp; Sidebars|Projects</strong>: Opens the left pane
    with the Project sidebar in the foreground.</li>

    <li><strong>Key Binding</strong>: The default key binding for
    opening and closing the left pane is 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'P'. See
    <a href="prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">Configuring
    Key Bindings</a> to alter or view the current assignment.</li>

    <li><strong>Workspace Toolbar</strong>: If the Workspace
    Toolbar is displayed, click the <strong>Show/Hide Left
    Pane</strong> button. (Select
    <strong>View|Toolbars|Workspace</strong> to display the
    toolbar.) Alternatively, click the <strong>Show Specific Sidebar/Tab
    </strong> button and select <strong>Projects</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="Creating_a_Project" id="Creating_a_Project">Creating
  Projects</a></h2>

  <p>To create a Project, use one of the following methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>File Menu</strong>: On the <strong>File</strong>
    menu, select <strong>New|New Project</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>File Menu</strong>: On the <strong>File</strong>
    menu, select <strong>New|New Project From Template...</strong>,
    select the desired project template and click
    <strong>Open</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: On the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu, click <strong>New
    Project</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: On the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu, click <strong>New Project From
    Template...</strong>, select the desired project template and
    click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Projects Sidebar: Project Tools|New
    Project</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>When creating a new project, you are prompted to select a
  directory where the project file is stored. The project filename
  becomes the project name displayed in the Projects Sidebar (without
  the ".kpf" extension). "Live" projects will automatically import
  the files and sub-directories in this directory.</p>

  <h3><a name="Live_Import" id="Live_Import">Live Import</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>Live Import</strong> option in <a href=
  "#project_props">Project Properties and Settings</a> (set
  globally in Komodo under <a href=
  "prefs.html#Directory_Import">Edit|Preferences|Directory
  Import</a>) makes the project behave as a <a href=
  "folders.html">Live Folder</a>. A project created with
  Live Import enabled is a <a href="#live_projects">live
  project</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Opening_a_Project" id="Opening_a_Project">Opening
  Projects</a></h2>

  <p>Existing projects are opened by any of the following
  methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>File|Open Menu</strong>: Select
    <strong>File|Open|Project</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: Select <strong>Project|Open
    Project</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Projects Sidebar: Project Tools|Open
    Project</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Recently opened projects can be accessed from the <a href=
  "workspace.html#Get_Started_Page">Komodo Start Page</a>, or
  from the <strong>File|Recent Projects</strong> menu. (The number
  of recently opened projects is determined by the <a href=
  "prefs.html#UI_Configuration">Most Recently Used</a>
  preference.)</p>

  <p>The project name and associated files are displayed on the
  <a class="doc" href=
  "workspace.html#Projects_Tab">Projects</a> tab. By default,
  opening a project only opens the project file, not the components
  associated with the project. The <a href=
  "prefs.html#projects">Opening and Closing Projects</a>
  preferences can change this behavior to automatically open recent
  project files (and close them when the project is closed).</p>

  <h2><a name="Switching_Between_Projects" id=
  "Switching_Between_Projects">Setting the Active Project</a></h2>

  <p>Multiple projects can be open at the same time. Components in
  any open project can be used. However, only one project at a time
  is "active". The active project is displayed in bold text. When
  the <strong>Add Component</strong> button in the Projects sidebar is
  invoked, the component is added to the active project, regardless
  of the project that is currently highlighted.</p>

  <p>Knowing which project is currently active is important because
  file preferences can be stored in projects. Komodo chooses a
  location for saved preferences based on the following
  criteria:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When debugging a file in the active project, preferences
    are stored in the active project.</li>

    <li>When debugging a file in a project which is open but not
    active, preferences are stored in the first project found
    containing that file.</li>

    <li>When debugging a file that is not in an open project,
    preferences are saved as a 'global' preference for that
    file.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To set the active project, right-click the desired project
  name and select <strong>Make Active Project</strong>, or select
  <strong>Project|Make Active Project</strong> from the drop-down
  menu.</p>

  <h2><a name="project_add_comp" id="project_add_comp">Adding
  Components to Projects</a></h2>

  <p>Projects are organization containers for "components".
  Components are items like files, folders, snippets, macros, etc.
  For information about individual components, refer to the
  relevant section of the documentation for the specific
  component.</p>

  <p>Filesystem-based components consists of items that exist as
  entities on the disk: <a href=
  "files.html#files_top">files</a> and <a href=
  "templates.html#templates_top">templates</a>.
  Komodo-specific components exist only in Komodo, and are not
  stored as external disk entities. Komodo-specific components
  include <a href="openshort.html#openshort_top">open
  shortcuts</a>, <a href=
  "folders.html#folders_top">folders</a>, <a href=
  "snippets.html#snippets_top">snippets</a>, <a href=
  "run.html#run_top">run commands</a>, <a href=
  "urls.html#urls_top">URL shortcuts</a>, <a href=
  "macros.html#macros_top">macros</a> and <a href=
  "custtbi.html#custtbi_top">custom menus and
  toolbars</a>.</p>

  <p>Within projects, filesytem-based components are merely
  references; they cannot be moved or deleted from within Komodo;
  moving them between projects and the Toolbox, or deleting them
  from projects or the Toolbox, has no effect on their actual
  disk-based location or their contents. On the other hand,
  Komodo-specific components (such as macros and snippets) do not
  exist outside of Komodo; therefore, they can be moved and copied
  (for example, from the Toolbox to the Projects sidebar) and deleted
  independently of the filesystem.</p>

  <p>For example, when a snippet (a Komodo-specific component) is
  copied from the Projects sidebar to the Toolbox, a new copy of the
  snippet is created; the original version still exists in the
  original location. Subsequent modifications of the snippet in the
  Toolbox do not change the version of the snippet stored in a
  project. On the other hand, when the contents of a file (a
  filesystem-based component) are changed, the changes apply
  regardless of the location from which the file is invoked.</p>

  <p>To add a component to a project:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project|Add</strong>: Use the
    <strong>Project</strong> drop-down menu. If multiple projects
    are open, the component is added to the project that is
    currently <a href=
    "#Switching_Between_Projects">active</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Project|Add|<em>project_name</em></strong>: When a
    project name is selected in the Projects sidebar, the selected
    project's name is also displayed in the
    <strong>Project</strong> drop-down menu. Components can be
    added directly to that project.</li>

    <li><strong>Add Button</strong>: Use the <strong>Add</strong>
    <img class="icon" src="img/projtb_add_butt.png" /> button on
    the <strong>Project</strong> tab. If multiple projects are
    open, the component will be added to the project that is
    currently selected.</li>

    <li><strong>Context Menu</strong>: Right-click a project name
    and select <strong>Add|<em>component</em></strong>.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Drag and drop components
      from:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop-Aware Applications</strong>:
        Filenames can be dragged from drag-and-drop applications
        (such as Windows Explorer).</li>

        <li><strong>Projects or Toolbox sidebars</strong>: Components can
        be dragged between projects, the Toolbox and container
        components (such as folders).</li>

        <li><strong>Editor File Name Tabs</strong>: When a file is
        open in the editor pane, drag and drop from the tab that
        displays the filename to a project.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Import from Filesystem</strong>: Right-click a
    project and select <strong>Import from File
    System</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Cut/Copy/Paste</strong>: All components have a
    right-click menu that includes the options
    <strong>Cut</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong> and
    <strong>Paste</strong>. Use these options to move components
    between projects, the Toolbox and container components.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some components have special component-specific mechanisms for
  being added to projects. For example, snippets can be created and
  added to a project in one step by selecting a block of text in
  the Editor Pane and dragging it onto a project. URL shortcuts are
  created by dragging and dropping a URL from a browser address bar
  or from the Editor Pane onto a project. Refer to the specific
  component sections for more information about these options.</p>

  <p>To remove a component from a project, click the desired
  component and press 'Delete', or right-click the component and
  select <strong>Delete</strong> from the context menu.</p>

  <p>Komodo-specific components (such as run commands, macros, etc)
  are permanently deleted. Filesystem-based components (such as
  files and dialog projects) are not; only the reference to the
  component within the project is removed.</p>

  <h2><a name="org_project" id="org_project">Project Display
  Settings</a></h2>

  <p>Use the button on the top right of the Projects Sidebar to select
  the fields that are displayed in the Projects sidebar. Click the
  column headings to organize the items according to the contents
  of any column.</p>

  <p>Column contents depend on the type of component. For example,
  the <strong>Status</strong> and <strong>Depot Rev</strong>
  display options only have contents if the component is part of a
  <a href="scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a>
  repository.</p>

  <p>The following columns can be displayed:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Date</strong>: The date from the filesystem when
    the component was last saved.</li>

    <li><strong>Size</strong>: The filesystem size of the
    component.</li>

    <li><strong>Status</strong>: The <a href=
    "scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a> status of
    the component.</li>

    <li><strong>Rev</strong>: When a component is part of a
    <a href="scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a>
    repository, this column displays the revision number of the
    local version of the file.</li>

    <li><strong>Depot Rev</strong>: When a component is part of a
    <a href="scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a>
    repository, this column displays the revision number of the
    repository version of the file.</li>

    <li><strong>Action</strong>: When a component is part of a
    <a href="scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a>
    repository, this column displays the current action (if any)
    being performed on the file. For example, if a file is
    currently opened for editing, the action is "edit".</li>

    <li><strong>Name</strong>: The name of the component. For
    filesystem-based components (such as files and dialog
    projects), the name is equivalent to the filename. For
    Komodo-specific components (such as macros and run commands),
    the name is the user-defined name assigned to the
    component.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="Saving_a_Project" id="Saving_a_Project">Saving
  Projects</a></h2>

  <p>If an asterisk is displayed beside the project name, the
  project has changed since it was opened or last saved. This
  happens not only when components are added, edited or removed in
  the Project Pane, but also when <a href=
  "debugger.html#Debugging_Options">debugging
  options</a> are changed for files in the project. To save a
  project:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>File Menu</strong>: On the <strong>File</strong>
    menu, click <strong>Save Project</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: On the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu, click <strong>Save
    Project</strong>. This saves the <a href=
    "#Switching_Between_Projects">active project</a>. If a project
    name is currently highlighted in the Projects sidebar, the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu contains an option for saving the
    selected project (<strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Save
    Project</strong>).</li>

    <li><strong>Projects Sidebar: Project Tools|Save Project</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Project Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    desired project and select <strong>Save Project</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The mechanisms described above can also be used to save a
  project to a new project file by selecting <strong>Save Project
  As...</strong> rather than <strong>Save</strong>.
  Filesystem-based components (such as files and dialog boxes) are
  relative references rather than actual entities; in the new
  project, the reference to the location of the component is
  preserved. Komodo-specific components (such as macros and run
  commands) are copied to the new project; there are independent
  versions of the component in the original project and in the new
  project.</p>

  <h2><a name="Refreshing_a_Project" id=
  "Refreshing_a_Project">Refreshing Project Status</a></h2>

  <p>The <strong>Refresh Status</strong> option checks read/write
  disk status for the project file and for filesystem-based
  components (such as files and dialog projects) within the
  project. If the project contains files of a language for which
  "code intelligence" is supported and enabled (as configured in
  the <a href="prefs.html#code_intel">Code Intelligence
  Preferences</a>), <strong>Refresh Status</strong> also updates
  the code intelligence database with the contents of those
  files.</p>

  <p>If the project or its components are stored in a <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a> system,
  <strong>Refresh Status</strong> also checks the repository status
  of the file. Komodo determines whether a file is contained in an
  SCC repository by the following methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perforce</strong>: query of the P4 repository (with
    the current user's client spec)</li>

    <li><strong>CVS</strong>: analysis of the CVS control
    directories</li>

    <li><strong>Subversion</strong>: analysis of the subversion
    control files</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="project_impexp" id="project_impexp">Importing and
  Exporting Projects via Packages</a></h2>

  <p>Entire projects (including all the components contained in a
  project) can be exported to a "package" file for distribution to
  other Komodo users or for the sake of archiving. Packages are
  compressed archive files that contain the project from which the
  <strong>Export Package</strong> option was invoked. The
  <strong>Export Package</strong> option differs from the
  <strong>Export as Project File</strong> option (provided for
  project components) in that <strong>Export Package</strong>
  creates a self-contained archive file that contains copies of all
  the filesystem-based components (such as files and dialogs).
  <strong>Export as Project File</strong>, on the other hand, only
  contains Komodo-specific components (such as snippets and run
  commands).</p>

  <p>To export a project and its contents to an archive, select
  <strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Export Package</strong>
  from the drop-down menu, or right-click the project and select
  <strong>Export Package</strong>.</p>

  <p>The Package Export Wizard prompts for a <strong>Package
  Name</strong> and a <strong>Export Location</strong>. The
  <strong>Package Name</strong> is the file in which the package is
  stored; it will have the extension ".kpz", and can be opened by
  any archiving utility that supports <code>libz</code> (for
  example WinZip).</p>

  <p>Exported packages can only be imported into "container"
  objects in Komodo, such as <a href=
  "#Creating_a_Project">projects</a>, the <a href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>, and <a href=
  "folders.html#folders_top">folders</a> within projects
  and the Toolbox.</p>

  <p>To import the contents of a package into a project,
  right-click the project to which you want to import the package,
  and click <strong>Import Package</strong>. The Package Import
  Wizard prompts for the name of the package and the location on
  disk where the files will be extracted. Click
  <strong>Next</strong> and then click <strong>Finish</strong> to
  complete the import.</p>

  <p>For information about importing packages to the Toolbox or a
  folder, see <a href=
  "toolbox.html#export_import">Toolbox - Import
  Package</a> and <a href=
  "folders.html#folders_importpack">Folders - Import
  Package</a> for more information.</p>

  <h2><a name="project_impcomp" id="project_impcomp">Importing
  Files from the File System</a></h2>

  <p>This option creates files within a project based on the
  directory structure and file contents of a local or network
  filesystem. File references within the project are created for
  imported files; folders are created for directories (depending on
  the configuration of the import options). To import a filesystem
  into a project:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: On the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu, click <strong>Import from File
    System</strong>. This imports the specified filesystem
    (according to the criteria described below) into the current
    <a href="#Switching_Between_Projects">active project</a>. If a
    project name is currently highlighted in the Projects sidebar, the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu contains an option for importing
    into the selected project
    (<strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Import from File
    System</strong>).</li>

    <li><strong>Project Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    desired project and select <strong>Import from File
    System</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Configure the following import options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Directory to import from</strong>: Specify the
    directory from which you want to import files. Use the
    <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate the file
    system.</li>

    <li><strong>Browse for directory location</strong>: Choose
    <strong>Locally...</strong> to browse the local filesystem or
    <strong>Remotely...</strong> to browse a <a href=
    "files.html#Opening_Remote_Files">remote
    filesystem</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Files to include</strong>: Specify the filenames to
    include. Use wildcards ("*" and "?") to specify groups of
    files. Separate multiple file specifications with semicolons.
    If the field is left blank, all files in the specified
    directory are imported.</li>

    <li><strong>Files and directories to exclude</strong>: Specify
    the file and directory names to exclude. Use wildcards ("*" and
    "?") to specify groups of files. Separate multiple file
    specifications with semicolons. If the field is left blank, no
    files in the specified directory are excluded.</li>

    <li><strong>Import Subdirectories Recursively</strong>: Select
    this check box to import directories (and files contained in
    those directories) located beneath the directory specified in
    the <strong>Directory to import from</strong> field. This check
    box must be checked in order to specify the "Import Directory
    Structure" option as the <strong>Type of folder structure to
    create</strong>.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Type of folder structure to create</strong>:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Import directory structure</strong>: If the
        <strong>Import Subdirectories Recursively</strong> box is
        selected and this option is selected, Komodo creates
        folders within the project that represent imported
        directories. Thus, the directory structure is preserved
        within the project.</li>

        <li><strong>Make a folder per language</strong>: If this
        option is selected, imported files are organized into
        folders according to the language indicated by file pattern
        in the filename. File associations are configured in the
        Komodo <a class="doc" href=
        "prefs.html#File_Associations">Preferences</a>.
        Each folder is named after the associated language, for
        example, "Perl files", "XML files", etc. Files that don't
        correspond to a known file pattern are stored in a folder
        called "Other files".</li>

        <li><strong>Make one flat list</strong>: If this option is
        selected, all the imported files are placed directly under
        the project from which the <strong>Import from File
        System</strong> command was invoked.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="project_scc" id="project_scc">Source Code
  Control</a> <span class="version_alert">Komodo IDE
  only</span></h2>

  <p><a href="scc.html#scc_top">Source code control</a>
  refers to projects and/or components stored in a source code
  control depot (such as a CVS or Perforce repository). There are
  two aspects to source code control within projects: source code
  control on the project file itself, and source code control on
  components contained in projects.</p>

  <p>When Komodo integration with a source code control system is
  <a href="prefs.html#scc">configured</a>, icons in the
  Project Manager display the SCC status of the project file and
  components contained in the project. See <a class="doc" href=
  "scc.html#file_status">file status icons</a> in the
  source code control documentation for more information about
  these icons.</p>

  <p>Source code control functions (such as adding files to an SCC
  repository, or opening files contained in a repository for
  editing) can be performed both on the project file, and on the
  components contained in the project. To access SCC commands for a
  project file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: Click the project name in
    the Project Manager, then select
    <strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Source
    Control</strong>).</li>

    <li><strong>Project Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    desired project and select <strong>Source
    Control</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To access SCC commands for the components contained in a
  project:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: Click the project name in
    the Project Manager, then select
    <strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Source Control on
    Contents</strong>).</li>

    <li><strong>Project Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    desired project and select <strong>Source Control on
    Contents</strong>.</li>

  commands.</p>

  <h2><a name="Reverting_a_Project" id=
  "Reverting_a_Project">Reverting Projects</a></h2>

  <p>If a project has been altered but has not been saved, use the
  <strong>Revert Project</strong> option to undo the changes. To
  access the <strong>Revert Project</strong> option:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    desired project and select <strong>Revert
    Project</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: Select
    <strong>Project|Revert Project</strong> or
    <strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Revert Project</strong>.
    <strong>Project|Revert Project</strong> reverts the <a href=
    "#Switching_Between_Projects">active project</a>. If a project
    name is currently highlighted in the Projects sidebar, the Project
    menu contains an option for reverting the selected project
    (<strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Revert
    Project</strong>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="Closing_Projects" id="Closing_Projects">Closing
  Projects</a></h2>

  <p>Closing a project removes it from the Projects sidebar. To close a
  project:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>File Menu</strong>: On the <strong>File</strong>
    menu, click <strong>Close Project</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Project Menu</strong>: On the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu, click <strong>Close
    Project</strong>. This closes the <a href=
    "#Switching_Between_Projects">active project</a>. If a project
    name is currently highlighted in the Projects sidebar, the
    <strong>Project</strong> menu contains an option for closing
    the selected project
    (<strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Close
    Project</strong>).</li>

    <li><strong>Project Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    desired project and select <strong>Close Project</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the project has changed since it was last saved, you are
  prompted to save it. If files contained in the project are open
  in the editor, you are asked if you wish to close them.</p>

  <h2><a name="project_delete" id="project_delete">Deleting
  Projects</a></h2>

  <p>When a project is deleted, the project file is deleted from
  disk; Komodo-specific components (such as run commands and
  macros) stored in the project are also deleted. Filesystem-based
  components (such as files and dialog projects) are not deleted.
  To delete a project, delete the project file from the
  filesystem.</p>

  <h2><a name="project_props" id="project_props">Project Properties
  and Settings</a></h2>

  <p>The Project Properties and Settings dialog box contains
  information about the project file, such as its size, its
  location on disk, its directory import settings, its source code
  control status, and project-specific language settings.</p>

  <p>To access the Project Properties dialog box, right-click the
  desired project name and select <strong>Properties</strong>, or
  click the desired project and select
  <strong>Project|<em>project_name</em>|Properties</strong> from
  the drop-down menu.</p>

  <p>The following categories are available:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Displays the name, size, and
    location of the project; the date and time it was created, last
    modified and last accessed; and indicates if the project is
    read-only.</li>

    <li><strong>Source Code Control</strong>: Displays SCC status
    as applicable (SCC System, Status, Depot Revision, and My
    Revision).</li>

    <li><strong>Debugging</strong>: Displays a subset of the
    settings available in the <a href=
    "debugger.html#Debugging_Options">Debugging
    Options</a> dialog box. These settings will take precedence
    over the default debugging settings for files in the
    project.</li>

    <li><strong>Directory Import</strong>: Defines how Komodo
    dynamically imports files and directories into the project.
    These settings override those configured in Komodo's global
    <a href="prefs.html#Directory_Import">Directory
    Import</a> preferences. Select the <strong>Live Import</strong>
    check box to keep the imported directories and files current
    with the file system via <a href=
    "folders.html#folders_top">Live Folders</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Languages</strong>: Allows you to add additional
    directories to a language's path for Komodo to use when
    debugging, syntax checking, or in the interactive shell. Komodo
    will also scan these directories for autocomplete and calltip
    information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="project_templates" id="project_templates">Project
  Templates</a></h2>

  <p>Project templates are useful if you find yourself repeatedly
  creating the same types of projects. See the <a href=
  "templates.html#project_templates">Project
  Templates</a> documentation for information on using Komodo's
  sample project templates, and saving your own.</p>
