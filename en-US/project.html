  <p>Komodo Projects are collections of settings and preferences that
  help you work with a particular set of files. These settings
  include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>the base directory to display in <a href="places.html">Places</a></li>
    <li>links to additional directories</li>
    <li>links to files</li>
    <li>arbitrary groups of file and directory links</li>
    <li>previously open files (optionally re-opened when the project becomes active)</li>
    <li>debugger preferences</li>
    <li>test plans</li>
    <li>language library paths</li>
    <li>mapped URIs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2><a id="project_pane"></a>Projects Pane</h2>
  
  <p>The <strong>Projects</strong> pane at the bottom of the <a
  href="places.html">Places</a> pane is the main interface to projects.
  It lists all open projects, showing the active project in bold.</p>
  
  <p>Double-clicking on a project in this list will make that project
  active and switch the <strong>Places</strong> pane above to the base
  directory of the project.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="project_active"></a>Open vs. Active Projects</h3>
  
  <p>Multiple projects can be opened in the Projects pane to give you
  quick access to that project's file and directory links, but only one
  project at a time can be active.</p>
  
  <p>If the active project has saved debugger settings, test plans,
  library search paths, or mapped URI's, these settings will be active
  for all files that are part of that project.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="project_menu">Projects Menu</a></h3>
  
  <p>The Projects menu is available in the toolbar for the Projects pane
  and as a right-click context menu. The toolbar menu operates on the
  active (boldface) project and the context menu operates on the
  selected project.</p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Show in Places</strong>: Changes the Places pane to the
    base directory of the project. The filesystem directory associated
    with the project can be overridden in the Properties.</li>
    <li><strong>Close Project</strong>: Closing the current project (as
    opposed to switching projects) clears the project preferences,
    reverting to whatever preferences or defaults are set globally.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project</strong>: Saves the current project
    properties to the ".komodoproject" file.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project As...</strong>: Saves a copy of the current
    project with a different name (or in a different location) and
    switches to the new project.</li>
    <li><strong>Rename Project...</strong>: Renames the current project
    in place.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Project in New Window</strong>: Each Komodo window
    can have only one active project oat a time. This feature spawns a
    new Komodo window with the selected project as the active one,
    allowin you to work with multiple projects silmultaneously.</li>
    <li><strong>Replace Project...</strong>: Switch to a different
    project.</li>
    <li><strong>New Project</strong>: Opens the filesystem browser to
    select the location and name of a new project. The project
    preferences and settings are stored in a ".komodoproject" file. The
    directory selected becomes the base directory for display in
    Places.</li>
    <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Opens the Properties and Settings
    dialog for the current or selected project.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2><a id="project_prefs">Project Properties and Settings</a></h2>
  
  <p>Komodo has preferences at the file, project and global level. File
  preferences take precedence over project preferencs which take
  precedence over global preferences. When a project is active, it's
  settings override global preferences wherever there is overlap.</p>
  
  <p>Project settings include the following sub-set of the global
  preferences:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><a href="debugger.html#Debugging_Options">Debugging</a></li>

        <li><a href="unittest.html">Test Plan Configuration</a></li>

        <!-- TODO: relink when Prefs have been fixed -->
        <li>Directory Import</li>

        <li><a href="prefs.html#lang_config">Languages</a></li>

        <li><a href="prefs.html#mapped_uris">Mapped URIs</a></li>
      </ul>
