  <p>Komodo Projects are collections of settings and preferences that
  help you work with a particular set of files. These settings
  include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>the base directory to display in <a href="places.html">Places</a></li>
    <li>links to additional directories</li>
    <li>links to files</li>
    <li>groups of file and directory links</li>
    <li>previously open files (optionally re-opened when the project becomes active)</li>
    <li>debugger preferences</li>
    <li>test plans</li>
    <li>language library paths</li>
    <li>mapped URIs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2><a id="project_pane"></a>Projects Pane</h2>
  
  <p>The <strong>Projects</strong> pane at the bottom of the <a
  href="places.html">Places</a> pane is the main interface to projects.
  It lists all open projects, showing the active project in bold.</p>
  
  <p>Double-clicking on a project in this list will make that project
  active and switch the <strong>Places</strong> pane above to the base
  directory of the project.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="project_active"></a>Open and Recent Projects</h3>
  
  <p>By default, only one project can be open at a time in each Komodo
  window. This active project is displayed at the top of the
  Projects list in bold with recently used projects following.</p>
  
  <p>You can switch between projects by double clicking any in the
  Recent Projects list, which can optionally close files belonging to
  the current project and open open files from the next one. Komodo
  takes a snapshot of which files are open when you close or switch
  projects, so the workspace can be restored when you open it again.
  This behavior is configurable in the <a
  href="prefs.html#projects">Projects and Workspace</a> preferences.</p>
  
  <p>Another setting in the <a href="places.html">Places</a>
  preferences lets you allow multiple open projects. With multiple
  projects open, only one project (per Komodo window) is "active" at a
  time. If the active project has saved debugger settings, test plans,
  library search paths, or mapped URI's, these settings will be enabled
  for all files that are part of that project.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="project_links"></a>File and Folder Links</h3>
  
  <p>Projects can contain links to files and folders on the local
  filesystem or on remote servers. Double-clicking on a file link opens
  it in an editor tab. Double-clicking on a folder link opens it in the
  <a href="places.html">Places</a> pane above.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="project_groups"></a>Project Groups</h3>
  
  <p>Groups are named virtual containers for files and folders. You can
  use them to organize items for quick access which might be in
  disparate locations. Groups are not actual direcories, they just
  contain links to files and folders (or sub-groups).</p>
  
  <h3><a id="project_menu">Project Menus</a></h3>
  
  <p>Projects menus are available in the main toolbar, the Projects pane
  toolbar and as a right-click context menu. The toolbar menus operate
  on the active project and the context menu operates on the selected
  project.</p>
  
  <p>Each menu offers a different list of options, but there is some
  overlap. The following options are available:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Show in Places</strong>: Changes the Places pane to the
    base directory of the project without making it the active project.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Project</strong>: Opens a diolog for choosing a
    .komodoproject file to open. The project is opened in the pane and
    becomes the active project by default.</li>
    <li><strong>New Project</strong>: Creates a new project, then opens
    it and makes it active.</li>
    <li><strong>Close Project</strong>: Removes the selected project
    from the Projects pane.</li>
    <li><strong>Close All Projects</strong>: Removes all projects from
    the Projects pane.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project</strong>: Saves the current project
    properties to the ".komodoproject" file.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Project As...</strong>: Saves a copy of the current
    project with a different name (or in a different location), then
    makes the new project active.</li>
    <li><strong>Rename Project...</strong>: Renames the current
    project.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Project in New Window</strong>: Each Komodo window
    can have only one active project at a time. This feature opens a
    new Komodo window with the selected project active, allowing you
    to work with multiple projects silmultaneously.</li>
    <li><strong>New Project</strong>: Opens the filesystem browser to
    select the location and name of a new project. The project
    preferences and settings are stored in a ".komodoproject" file. The
    directory selected becomes the base directory for display in
    Places.</li>
    <li><strong>Refresh Status</strong>: Updates the filesystem and
    source code control status of all files and directories in the
    project.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Add</strong>: Add files folders and groups.
      <ul>
        <li>New File: Add a new file to the project or folder (depending
        on context or selection).</li>
        
        <li>New Group: Add a new named group of folders or files.</li>
        
        <li>Existing File: Select a file to include in the project,
        folder or group.</li>
        
        <li>Existing Folder: Select a filesystem folder to include in a
        project or group.</li>
        
        <li>Existing Remote File / Folder: As above, but using the remote
        filesystem browser.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Source Code Control</strong>: A sub-menu of <a href="scc.html">SCC actions</a>. (Komodo IDE only)</li>
    <li><strong>Publishing</strong>: A sub-menu of <a href="publish.html">Publishing actions</a>. (Komodo IDE only)</li>
    <li><strong>Show in File Manager</strong>: Open the selection in the system's default file manager.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove</strong>: Remove the selection from the project.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Opens the Properties and Settings
    dialog for the current or selected project.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2><a id="project_prefs">Project Properties and Settings</a></h2>
  
  <p>Komodo has preferences at the file, project and global level. File
  preferences take precedence over project preferencs which take
  precedence over global preferences. When a project is active, it's
  settings override global preferences wherever there is overlap.</p>
  
  <p>Project settings include the following sub-set of the global
  preferences:</p>
  
      <ul>
        
        
        <li><a href="debugger.html#Debugging_Options">Debugging</a></li>
