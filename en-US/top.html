  <h1 id="title">Welcome to the Komodo User Guide</h1>


  <div class="app-editonly">
    <h2 class="first"><a href="releases/ide.html#whatsnew">What's new in Komodo Edit</a></h2>

    <ul>

      <li><p><strong>Komodo Color Schemes</strong>:
      There are now a lot more dark based color schemes included in Komodo by
      default. Most of these new schemes were contributed by existing users of
      Komodo - if you have your own favourite color scheme you want included in
      Komodo then please send it in.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Preference Searching</strong>: Komodo now provides a search box
      in the preferences page that can be used to narrow down the appropriate
      preference categories for the preference you are looking for.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Notifications Pane</strong>: There is now a new notifications
      panel located in Komodo's bottom pane that is used to keep track of the events
      occurring in Komodo. Statusbar messages, SCC actions and other events will now
      populate this Notifications panel - this allows easy reviewing, checking and
      copying of Komodo events.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Document Toolbar</strong>: A new toolbar has been placed at the
      top of each editor tab. This toolbar will now contain editor specific controls
      such as the Sections List popup, Language selection and file encoding choices.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Customize the Main Toolbar</strong>: It's now possible to
      select the individual toolbar items you wish to be shown in the main
      Komodo toolbar. Use the <em>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize...</em> menu
      to start your tweaking.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Code Completion Widget</strong>: The code completions widget
      inside of Komodo has changed. Whilst most users shouldn't the difference
      between the old and new completion widget, this will allow adding of
      additional information to the completions dialog and also allow us to add
      smarter code completions.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Fast Find</strong>:
      A new interactive find widget has been added to the Komodo editor, which will
      speed up the time taken to search for text within documents. Using Ctrl+F
      (Cmd+F) now brings up a small textbox at the bottom of the editor view where
      you can type the text you wish to search for. The searching is done
      incrementally as you type, so you'll see your matches instantly.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>:
      Komodo's code intelligence provides support for the core Node library, as
      well support for the CommonJS module specification, which is used in Node
      for requiring (importing) JavaScript modules.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Moveable Side Pane Widgets</strong>:
      You can now easily move any of Komodo's side pane widgets to a different
      pane, such as being able to move the Code Browser to the right side
      instead of the left. Just right-click on the side-pane tab you wish to
      move and you'll see a context menu offering you the ability to move the
      tab to an alternative pane.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Syntax Checking</strong>: Komodo's syntax checking feature has
      been greatly improved in Komodo 7. We've added:
        <ul>
          <li>
        Multi-language syntax checking - you'll now see errors and warnings
        for JavaScript and CSS sections in an HTML document
          </li>
          <li>
        A syntax checking tab in the bottom pane - you can see those errors
        and warnings all in one place
          </li>
          <li>
        A wider range of syntax checkers to choose from - including JSLint for
        JavaScript and PyLint for Python
          </li>
          <li>
        The ability to enable or disable syntax checkers on a per-file or
        per-language level
          </li>
          <li>
        Preference options - complete customization of syntax checking
        parameters
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Project Preferences</strong>: There are now a wider range of
      preferences that can be set on a per-project basis, such as the language
      interpreter preferences, project-wide indentation settings and syntax
      checking options.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Updated Mozilla Code Base</strong>: Komodo is now on the
      Firefox 4 (mozilla-2.0) code base, which means:
        <ul>
          <li>
        Faster startup - no component registration, so the first startup and
        restarts after add-on installation will be substantially faster.
          </li>
          <li>
        A better browser preview - supporting the lastest and greatest web
        technologies
          </li>
          <li>
        Stability - improvements to the underlying Mozilla code will make
        Komodo itself more stable
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>New Languages</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Mojolicious - a Perl templating language</li>
          <li>CoffeeScript - a JavaScript templating language</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </li>

    </ul>

  <div class="app-ideonly">
    <h2 class="first"><a href="releases/ide.html#whatsnew">What's new in Komodo IDE</a></h2>

    <ul>

      <li><p><strong><a href="../profiling.html">Code Profiling</a></strong>:
      Komodo IDE now supports code profiling of Python and PHP applications.
      This allows you to easily code profile an application in order to see
      where the hotspots are. Komodo also supports the Cachegrind/Callgrind
      specification, so you can open up generic cachegrind profile files and
      view them with Komodo's code profiler tools.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong><a href="../codeintel.html#codeintel_codebrowser">Better Code Browsing</a></strong>:
      The Code Browser will now only show the outline for the currently edited file,
      though you can easily change this to show all files if you wish. The code
      browser can now be automatically synced with your current editor position,
      meaning the code browser will update it's context as you move around in the
      editor.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Debugger - Highlight Changed Variables</strong>:
      When debugging an application inside of Komodo IDE, the watch and variable
      windows will now highlight any variables that have changed from the last
      break position, so as you stepping over your code, you can now easily tell
      when a variable has changed.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Komodo Color Schemes</strong>:
      There are now a lot more dark based color schemes included in Komodo by

      </li>

      <li><p><strong><a href="http://www.stackato.com/">Stackato Integration</a></strong>:
      Stackato is ActiveState's cloud hosting platform. Komodo provides tools
      that will allow you to easily configure, develop, manage and deploy
      applications to the Stackato platform. These tools are located in your
      Komodo toolbox pane.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>:
      Komodo now provides excellent code intelligence and debugging support for
      Node. Komodo's debugger can connect and interact with the Node V8 runtime,
      to show variables, set breakpoints, modify objects or view the call stack
      - Komodo's debugger makes all of these things easy. As well as debugging,
      Komodo's code intelligence provides support for the core Node library, as
      well support for the CommonJS module specification, which is used in Node
      for requiring (importing) JavaScript modules.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong><a href="sync.html">Komodo Synchronization</a></strong>:
      Synchronize your important Komodo data between multiple machines. Changes made
      to the toolbox, remote server accounts or template files can be synchronized
      between all of the machines you use Komodo on.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong><a href="collab.html">Code Collaboration</a></strong>: Two or more
      people can collaborate on the same document in real time. Changes made each
      individual user will be propagated to all other collaborators.
        </p>
      </li>
