    <h2><a href="releases/ide.html#whatsnew">What's new in Komodo Edit</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workspace Save and Restore</strong>: Komodo will now be
      regularly saving your workspace. In the case of an unexpected
      shutdown, you can choose to restore your last used workspace the next
      time it starts up.</li>

      <li><strong>Places</strong>: A new file manager has been added
      to Komodo's left pane. It provides a customized view of your file
      system (local or remote) and easy file management operations such as
      file editing, drag/drop copying, creation of new files and folders,
      and search.</li>

      <li><strong>Projects</a></strong>: Komodo projects are now
      integrated with the new Places component. Opened and recent Projects
      will be visible in a bottom pane of the Places panel. All projects
      are now live folders (no virtual folders) with only one project
      being opened/active at a time. Project preferences apply to all
      opened files (even if the file does not reside in the projects base
      directory). Project tools (macros, run commands, snippets, etc...)
      are now be displayed in the Komodo toolbox area.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Faster</strong>: A number of Komodo components have been
      made to run faster, such as startup, shutdown, tab-switching and
      finding text. The underlying Mozilla source code has been updated to
      version 1.9.1, the same code base as Firefox 3.5, which means
      improved performance gains for Komodo.</li>

      <li><strong>New Toolbox</strong>: The Komodo toolbox and project
      system are being rewritten. Individual toolbox items (commands,
      macros, snippets, etc.) are saved in separate JSON files rather than
      as nodes in a toolbox.kpf file. There is a new "Invoke Tool" command
      which allows you to easily search and then execute specific tools.
      In future versions project-specific tools will appear in the Toolbox
      sidebar instead of the Projects sidebar, which will eventually be
      removed.</li>

      <li><strong>Hyperlink Additions</strong>: Hyperlinks have been extended and can now...
        <ul>
          <li>show image preview while hovering on an image link,</li>
          <li>show Code Intelligence definitions while hovering on a symbol,</li>
          <li>jump to an HTML anchor tag to it's definition,</li>
          <li>jump to HREF and SRC locations,</li>
          <li>open files from a path reference,</li>
          <li>jump to PHP file includes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>HTML 5 and CSS3 Support</strong>: Autocomplete for HTML 5
      and CSS3.</li>
      
      <li><strong>More Languages</strong>: Syntax highlighting for
      COBOL, Markdown, MySQL, Nimrod, PowerPro, SML, Sorcus, TACL, and
      TAL.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2><a href="releases/ide.html#whatsnew">What's new in Komodo IDE</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Database Explorer</strong>: Lets you easily explore local
      and remote database installations, including viewing and managing
      data. SQLite is supported in this release, with more databases coming
      soon. Support for each database is implemented as a Komodo
      extension, so integration with other databases can be easily
      added.</li>

      <li><strong>Places</strong>: A new file manager has been added
      to Komodo's left pane. It provides a customized view of your file
      system (local or remote) and easy file management operations such as
      file editing, drag/drop copying, creation of new files and folders,
      and search.</li>

      <li><strong>Projects</a></strong>: Komodo projects are now
      integrated with the new Places component. Opened and recent Projects
      will be visible in a bottom pane of the Places panel. All projects
      are now live folders (no virtual folders) with only one project
      being opened/active at a time. Project preferences apply to all
      opened files (even if the file does not reside in the projects base
      directory). Project tools (macros, run commands, snippets, etc...)
      are now be displayed in the Komodo toolbox area.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Publishing</strong>: Copy remote files to your
      local system to work on them, then push them back to the remote
      system when you're done. Komodo keeps track of the synchronization
      details to avoid copying files that haven't changed, as well as
      using advanced conflict detection to avoid overwriting changes made
      by others.</li>

      <li><strong>New Toolbox</strong>: The Komodo toolbox and project
      system are being rewritten. Individual toolbox items (commands,
      macros, snippets, etc.) are saved in separate JSON files rather than
      as nodes in a toolbox.kpf file. There is a new "Invoke Tool" command
      which allows you to easily search and then execute specific tools.
      In future versions project-specific tools will appear in the Toolbox
      sidebar instead of the Projects sidebar, which will eventually be

      time it starts up.</li>

          <li>jump to an HTML anchor tag to it's definition,</li>
          <li>jump to HREF and SRC locations,</li>
          <li>open files from a path reference,</li>
          <li>jump to PHP file includes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Rx Toolkit Improvements</strong>: Choose between Python,
      Perl, PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript syntax for testing your Regular
      Expressions. They are now evaluated "out of process", so a
      long-running regular expression won't tie up the IDE.</li>
      
      <li><strong>HTML 5 and CSS3 Support</strong>: Autocomplete for HTML 5
      and CSS3.</li>
      
      <li><strong>More Languages</strong>: Syntax highlighting for
      COBOL, Markdown, MySQL, Nimrod, PowerPro, SML, Sorcus, TACL, and
