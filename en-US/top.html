    <h3 id="whatsnew-edit-8.5">8.5</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Multiple Carets</strong>: In addition to Komodo's rectangular
        (column) editing, you can now add multiple caret positions in the editor,
        so that any typing or editing commands will be reflected at all caret
        locations. Use Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click on the Mac) to place additional
        carets, or alternatively use the editors right click contextual menu and
        select the 'Add as Additional Caret/Selection'.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Button Menu</strong>: Komodo can now be configured to use a
        collapsed toolbar button menu, instead of a full menu bar (does not
        apply to Mac OS X). This can be useful when you want to maximize your
        vertical editing space. A bonus of this feature is that the last used
        menu items will also be displayed in the top-level of the button menu,
        making it quick and easy to run the same menu command again.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Sleek Scrollbars</strong>: Komodo's side pane scrollbars now
        fade out when they are not in use. This creates more space for your
        panes, and the scrollbars will become more visible and less transparent
        once you start interacting with the pane.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Performance</strong>: Various performance tweaks were made to
        Komodo 8.5 to improve the editing performance, as well as improving the
        search speed, syntax checking times and general responsiveness of
        Komodo.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Mac Improvements</strong>: Drawing is smoother and Komodo can
        draw using the integrated graphics card. There were some edge cases on
        Retina screens where drawing glitches could occur in the editor
        component, leaving unwanted artefacts - this has now been fixed. Komodo
        can now work with the integrated graphics card - this can lead to
        improved battery life on laptops.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Breadcrumbs</strong>: A new file and directory navigation bar
        has been added to the Komodo window. This navigation bar allows you to
        easily find and open related files. You can use mouse and/or keyboard
        to navigate entries and easily filter down the list of files.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Abyss theme</strong>: A new dark theme for the Komodo user
        interface has been added. This theme affects the Komodo UI elements
        outside of the main editor (i.e. different from Komodo color schemes which
        only affect the main editor colors). You can enable Abyss in the Komodo
        <em>Appearance</em> preferences.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Open Files</strong>: The Open Files widget (in the left Komodo
        Pane) now includes additional sorting and grouping options. You can
        group by language, file extension, directory, location and even group by
        a custom regex pattern match.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Code Intelligence Out-Of-Process</strong>: Komodo's code
        intelligence system (code scanning, calltips, completions, goto
        definition, refactoring, etc...) is now handled by an external process.
        Mostly you won't notice any changes in functionality, but this does boost
        Komodo's responsiveness whilst editing.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Updated Platform</strong>: Komodo has received a number of
        updates to its underlying code base. Komodo now uses Mozilla 24, Python
        2.7.5 and Scintilla 3.34.
      </p>

      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Code Refactoring</strong>: The new Komodo refactoring component
        has these smart code-transformation capabilities:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Variable Renaming</strong>: quickly and easily rename
          variables in the editor. It uses inline markers and multiple cursor
          selections to easily change the name of a code variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Method Extraction</strong>: move parts of your code into a
          new function. Any variables used in the selected text are refactored
          into function arguments and are then passed to the extracted
          method.</li>
        </ul>
        Note that code refactoring will only work with languages that provide
        code intelligence information (i.e. PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript,
        Node.js).
      </p>
