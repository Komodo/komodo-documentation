        <strong>Track Changes</strong>: The editor has gained a new left margin,
        which highlights unsaved changes, as well as any uncommitted SCC
        changes. Clicking on the margin will show a diff dialog of the changes,

      <p>
        <strong>Markdown Viewer</strong>: When a markdown file is open in
        Komodo, you'll be able to easily HTML preview that markdown with a click
        of a button. The Komodo markdown viewer uses GitHub markdown styling.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Go Lang</strong>: Initial support for the Go programming
        language has been added to Komodo. It provides syntax coloring, code
        folding, syntax checking (linting) and code intelligence with
        completions, calltips, outline and goto definition.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Commando</strong>: This popup dialog is the combined successor
        of the "Fast Open" dialog and "Invoke Tool" dialog. Commando provides
        the following search tools and features:
        <ul>
          <li>fuzzy matching</li>
          <li>string match highlighting in the results panel</li>

        code with other people (like a pastebin) directly from Komodo. Simple
        make a text selection and right-click and use the <em>Share Code via
        Kopy.io</em>. Even better is that Kopy.io supports client side
        encryption, so you can make those shared pastes more secure.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Notifications</strong>: Messages shown to the user now appear in
        a separate popup panel that overlays the main Komodo editor window

        notification preferences which allows you to control which messages get
        displayed in the popup panel.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Icons</strong>: Most of the Komodo UI icons have been updated -

    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Color Schemes</strong>: We've changed all the default Komodo
        color schemes. All schemes included in Komodo are now Base16, that is,
        they are based on a set of 16 different base colors, which are re-used
        by different parts of the scheme. You can also tweak the editor line
        height spacing now directly in the color scheme preferences page.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Menu Bar</strong>: The Komodo main menu bar is now hidden by
        default (Windows and Linux. You can use the Alt key to toggle the menu
        visibility. Whilst the top-level menu is hidden, the unified button menu
        will be visible in the toolbar. You can also control menu visibility

        <strong>Komodo Developer APIs</strong>: We've been overhauling the
        Komodo APIs, to make it easier to load and access the methods inside
        of Komodo. We're now making use of CommonJS (aka Node.js)
        <em>require()</em> calls to load individual modules - you can see the
        full list of supported modules in the
        <a href="https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/tree/master/src/chrome/komodo/content/sdk">sdk directory</a>.

            <strong>Package Manager Integration</strong>: Easily manage your
            project dependencies right from Komodo, using nothing but your
            keyboard. Commando will allow you to search for available and
            installed packages, and even for package managers that generally
            make this task fairly cumbersome (i.e. NPM and CPANM).

            Komodo IDE package managers are available for Bower, NPM, Composer,
            Gem, PIP, CPAN, PyPM and PPM. Adding support for your own package
            manager (or just shell commands in general) is easily added through
            macros and/or addons.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>Shell Scope</strong>: Easily run commands from Komodo right
            from Commando. Of course you could already run commands from Komodo,
            but now you can do it in style and without interrupting your workflow.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>Improved Workspace Management</strong>: We've significantly
            improved the workspace management functionality in Komodo IDE.
            Easily create your own custom configurations for Komodo and load
            them on the fly.
