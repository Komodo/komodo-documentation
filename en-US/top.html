    <h2 class="first"><a href="releases/ide.html#whatsnew">What's new in Komodo Edit</a></h2>

    <ul>

      <li><p><strong>Find/Replace in Buffers</strong>:
      When working over a set of files, find/replace now looks at
      loaded, changed buffers instead of their corresponding (older)
      files on disk.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Drag/Drop onto Project Panel</strong>:
      Files can now be dragged into projects or group folders from the
      system file browser, the Places panel, or editor tabs.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Komodo Color Schemes</strong>:
      There are now a lot more dark based color schemes included in Komodo by
      default. Most of these new schemes were contributed by existing users of
      Komodo - if you have your own favourite color scheme you want included in
      Komodo then please send it in.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Preference Searching</strong>: A new filter box
      in the Preferences dialog helps you quickly find the setting
      you are looking for.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Notifications Pane</strong>: The new Notifications
      panel in the bottom pane tracks events occurring in Komodo.
      Statusbar messages, SCC actions and other events can be expanded
      for more detail, filtered and copied.
        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Customizable Main Toolbar</strong>: It's now possible to
      select the individual toolbar items you wish to be shown in the main
      Komodo toolbar. Use <strong>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize...</strong> 
      to start your tweaking.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Code Completion Widget</strong>: The code
      completions widget inside of Komodo has changed. While most users
      won't notice the difference, the new widged allows for
      additional information and smarter code completions in future.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Fast Find</strong>:
      A new interactive Find widget has been added which will
      speed up searching for text within documents. Using Ctrl+F
      (Cmd+F) now brings up a small textbox at the bottom of the editor view where
      you can type the text you wish to search for. The searching is done
      incrementally as you type, so you'll see your matches instantly.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>:
      Komodo now provides excellent code intelligence for
      Node, with  support for the core Node.js
      libraries, as well support for the CommonJS module specification,
      which is used in Node for requiring (importing) JavaScript
      modules.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Moveable Side Pane Widgets</strong>:
      Any of Komodo's side pane widgets can now be moved to different
      panes. Move the Code Browser to the right side instead of the left
      or move the DB Explorer to the bottom. Just right-click on the
      side-pane tab choose the pane you want to move it to.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Syntax Checking</strong>: Komodo's syntax checking feature has
      been greatly improved in Komodo 7. We've added:
        <ul>
          <li>
        Multi-language syntax checking - you'll now see errors and warnings
        for JavaScript and CSS sections in an HTML document
          </li>
          <li>
        A syntax checking tab in the bottom pane - you can see those errors
        and warnings all in one place
          </li>
          <li>
        A wider range of syntax checkers to choose from - including JSLint for
        JavaScript and PyLint for Python
          </li>
          <li>
        The ability to enable or disable syntax checkers on a per-file or
        per-language level

      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Updated Mozilla Code Base</strong>: Komodo is now on the
      Mozilla 7 code base, which means:
        <ul>
          <li>
        Faster startup - no component registration, so the first startup and
        restarts after add-on installation will be substantially faster.
          </li>
          <li>
        A better browser preview - supporting the lastest and greatest web
        technologies
          </li>
          <li>
        Stability - improvements to the underlying Mozilla code will make
        Komodo itself more stable

      <li><p><strong>Notifications Pane</strong>: There is now a new notifications
      panel located in Komodo's bottom pane that is used to keep track of the events
      occurring in Komodo. Statusbar messages, SCC actions and other events will now
      populate this Notifications panel - this allows easy reviewing, checking and

        </p>
      </li>
    
      <li><p><strong>Customize the Main Toolbar</strong>: It's now possible to

      smarter code completions.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p><strong>Fast Find</strong>:
      A new interactive find widget has been added to the Komodo editor, which will
