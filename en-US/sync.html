  <h2 id="sync_account">Account Setup</h2>
  
  <p>Before you can start Sync or <a
  href="collab.html">Collaboration</a>, you have to set up your
  ActiveState account in Komodo. If you do not have one, you can
  create one for free at:</p>
  
  <a href="https://account.activestate.com/signup/">https://account.activestate.com/signup/</p>

  <p>To set up the account, select <strong>Tools|Komodo Services|My
  Account</strong> from the menu. Enter the email adress and
  password of your ActiveState.com account and click <strong>Login</strong>. If your
  login data was valid, you should see the message "You're logged in to
  Komodo Services".</p>

  <h2 id="sync_what_is">Komodo Sync</h2>
  
  <p>Sync keeps your Komodo profile data (toolbox, color schemes,
  keybindings and other preferences) synchronized between all the
  machines you run Komodo on. Komodo uploads parts of your Komodo
  profile to a remote Komodo Sync server hosted by ActiveSate. Your
  other machines can then download the profile data and upload any
  changes that are made to the profile, so it stays synchronized. Your
  data is password protected and encrypted before upload. Only you have
  access to the things you upload to the ActiveState Komodo Sync server.</p>
  
  <h3 id="sync_setup">Setup</h3>
  
  <p>Select <stong>Tools|Komodo Services|Set Up Sync...</strong> from
  the menu bar to open the Sync setup wizard.</p>
  
  <p>When you click the <strong>Continue</strong> button, Komodo displays the
  "Sync Key" it has automatically generated for you. The Sync Key is used to
  encrypt all the data before it is uploaded to the Sync Server. Please store it
  in a safe place. You will need it to set up Sync on any additional computers. To
  keep your data secure, the Sync Key itself is only stored locally, not
  on the ActiveState servers, so there is no way to recover your Sync
  Key if it is lost.</p>
  
  <p>It's a good idea to email your Komodo Sync key to yourself, as
  you'll need to be able to retrieve it later for your other Komodo
  installations.</p>
  
  <p>Click <strong>Continue</strong> again to finish the Sync
  setup. You can also click <strong>Sync Options</strong> button to
  select which items to keep in Sync.</p>
  
  <h3 id="sync_syncing">Syncing your Data</h3>
  
  <p>After setup, Komodo will automatically contact the Komodo Sync
  server every hour to synchronize your profile data. You can also start
  synchronization manually by clicking on the Sync icon in the bottom
  right corner of the Komodo window. Note that the first synchronization
  may take some time because all data has to be uploaded to the server.
  Later, only data that has changed will need to transferred.</p>
  
  <h3 id="sync_other_machines">Setting Up Other Machines</h3>
  
  <p>Setting up Sync on subsequent machines is similar to the steps
  above, but there are two important differences:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>The setup wizard will prompt you for the Sync Key that was
    generated when you set up Sync for the first time, rather than
    generating a new one.</li>
    
    <li>When you click the <code>Sync Options</code> button you can
    choose what Sync should do with the data from the machine you're
    setting up.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The safest choice is to merge the data. Sync will download all the
  data from the server, apply it on the machine you are setting up and
  then upload all new data to the Sync server. Alternatively, you can
  also choose to replace all data on the server with your local data and
  vice versa.</p>
