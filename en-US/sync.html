  <h2 id="set_up_sync">Set up Sync</h2>
  
  <p>Before you can use Sync or <a href="collab.html">Collaboration</a>,
  you have to set up your ActiveState account in Komodo. If you do not
  have one, you can create one for free at: <a
  href="https://account.activestate.com/signup/">https://account.activestate.com/signup/</a>
  </p>

  <p>To set up the account, select <strong>Tools &gt; Set Up Sync </strong>
  from the menu. Enter the email address and password of your ActiveState
  account and click <strong>Login</strong>. If your login data was valid, you
  should see the <strong>Your Sync Key</strong> text field.  Komodo displays the
  "Sync Key" it has automatically generated for you. The Sync Key is used to encrypt all
  the data before it is uploaded to the Sync Server. Please store it in a safe
  place. You will need it to set up Sync on any additional computers. To keep
  your data secure, the Sync Key itself is only stored locally, not on the
  ActiveState servers, so there is no way to recover your Sync Key if it is
  lost.</p>
  
  <p>It's a good idea to email your Komodo Sync key to yourself, as you'll need
  to be able to retrieve it later for your other Komodo installations.  Click
  <strong>Next</strong> and finally <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>


  <h2 id="sync_sync">Synchronizing Komodo</h2>
  
  <p>Sync keeps your Komodo profile data synchronized between all the machines
  you run Komodo on. Komodo uploads parts of your Komodo profile to a
  remote Komodo Sync server hosted by ActiveSate. Your other machines
  can then download the profile data and upload any changes that are
  made to the profile, so it stays synchronized. Your data is password
  protected and encrypted before upload. Only you have access to the
  things you upload to the ActiveState Komodo Sync server.</p>
  
  <h3 id="sync_items">Sync Items</h3>

  <p>You can configure the list of profile items that you'd like to
  have synced through the Setup process. These are the list of profile
  items available:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Toolbox Items</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Key Binding Schemes</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Color Schemes</strong></li>
    <li><strong>File Templates</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Project Templates</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Code Intelligence API Catalogs</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Preferences</strong> <br/>
      These are the specific preference items that are synced:
      <ul>
        <li>Appearance > Show Komodo Start Page on startup</li>
        <li>Appearance > Side Pane Layouts > Left, Right and Bottom panes</li>
        <li>Appearance > Most Recently Used > Number of files and projects</li>
        <li>Debugger > Show expression values in hover tooltips</li>
        <li>Editor > Smart Editing > Use Tab character to complete words like</li>
        <li>Editor > Smart Editing > Cut/Copy with no selection</li>
        <li>Fast Open > Enable Open Files gatherer</li>
        <li>Fast Open > Enable Current Project gatherer</li>
        <li>Fast Open > Enable Current Working Directory gatherer</li>
        <li>Fast Open > Enable go-tool integration</li>
        <li>Fast Open > Enable History gatherer</li>
        <li>Fast Open > History max entries</li>
        <li>Servers</li>
        <li>Syntax Checking > JavaScript > Enable warning messages</li>
        <li>Syntax Checking > JavaScript > Enable strict warning messages</li>
        <li>Syntax Checking > HTML > Tidy > Error level</li>
        <li>Syntax Checking > HTML > Tidy > Accessibility level</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
   
  <h3 id="sync_data">Synchronizing your Data</h3>
  
  <p>After setup, Komodo will automatically contact the Komodo Sync
  server every hour to synchronize your profile data. You can also start
  synchronization manually by clicking on the Sync icon in the bottom
  right corner of the Komodo window. Note that the first synchronization
  may take some time because all data has to be uploaded to the server.
  Later, only data that has changed will need to transferred.</p>
  
  <h3 id="sync_komodo_versions">Synchronizing between different Komodo versions</h3>

  <p>Komodo will only sync a subset of items when syncing between differing
  major versions of Komodo (i.e. Komodo 7.1 to Komodo 8.0).</p>

  <p>These items will not sync between different major versions:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Toolbox Items</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Preferences</strong></li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Note that Komodo's regular profile upgrade (e.g. from 7.1 to 8.0) can be
  used to upgrade these two items.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sync_other_machines">Additional Machines</h3>
  
  <p>Setting up Sync on subsequent machines is similar to the steps
  above, but there are two important differences:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>The setup wizard will prompt you for the Sync Key that was
    generated when you set up Sync for the first time, rather than
    generating a new one.</li>
    
    <li>When you click the <strong>Sync Options</strong> button you can
    choose what Sync should do with the data from the machine you're
    setting up.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The safest choice is to merge the data. Sync will download all the
  data from the server, apply it on the machine you are setting up and
  then upload all new data to the Sync server. Alternatively, you can
  also choose to replace all data on the server with your local data and
  vice versa.</p>
