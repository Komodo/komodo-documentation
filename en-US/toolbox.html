  <p>Komodo has a Toolbox sidebar for storing tools - bits of code that
  you can quickly add to Komodo to automate tasks, integrate extrnal
  tools, or just store snippets of text or links. These following types
  of tools can be added anywhere in the Toolbox sidebar:</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li><a href="macros.html">macros</a></li>
    <li><a href="run.html">commands</a></li>
    <li><a href="snippets.html">snippets</a></li>
    <li><a href="templates.html">templates</a></li>
    <li><a href="urls.html">URLs</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The top level of the Toolbox sidebar is considered the global
  toolbox. This is an area for tools that are generally applicable for
  any file you might be working on. Tools can be grouped into folders to
  keep them organized.</p>
  
  <p>There are also two optional toolboxes which are displayed under
  special toolbox icons within the sidebar:</p>
      
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shared Toolbox</strong>: An optional toolbox for teams
    of people to share tools, or a place to put tools that are shared
    between multiple installations of Komodo. The location of this
    toolbox is configured in the <a
    href="prefs.html#Shared_Support">Shared Support</a>
    preferences.</li>
  
    <li><strong>Project Toolbox</strong>: Tools specific to a particular
    project, only visible when that project is active.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a id="tools_add_rem">Adding, Removing and Managing Tools</a></h2>
  
  <p><strong>To add an item to the toolbox</strong>: click the Tools menu button and
  select the type of tool you want (e.g. "New Macro..."). A relevant
  dialog box will open with options for the tool. Clicking "OK" adds it
  the new tool at the top level of the Toolbox.</p>
  
  <p><strong>To add an item in a specific place</strong>: right-click on
  the desired folder or toolbox, and select <strong>Add|New...</strong>
  from the context menu.</p>

  <p><strong>To remove an item</strong>: select it and hit the Delete
  key or right-click on it and choose "Delete" from the context menu</p>
  
  <p>Tools can be dragged between folders and toolboxes or cut/copy
  pasted anywhere in the Toolbox sidebar.</p>
  
  <!-- TODO - describe in detail
  Behind the scenes:
  
  Tooboxes are stored as special directories containing a file for each tool.
  
  Global: user data dir -> tools directory
  Shared: tools directory anywhere in the filesystem
  Project: .komodotools hidden directory in the same directory as the 
  
  
  Tools are stored in .komodotool JSON files.

  <p>The Komodo Toolbox stores components that are frequently used.
  The Toolbox is similar to a persistent <a href=
  "project.html#project_top">project</a>; however,
  rather than storing components that are specific to a particular
  project, it stores components that are used for a variety of
  tasks.</p>

  <p>The Projects Manager and the Toolbox share a common set of
  components. Components are of two types: Komodo-specific
  components (such as macros, run commands and custom menus) and
  filesystem-based components (such as files and dialog
  projects).</p>

  <p>Components within the Projects sidebar and the Toolbox are
  manipulated using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, by
  context menus, or via the <strong>Project</strong> and
  <strong>Toolbox</strong> drop-down menus. Component options are
  accessed via the drop-down menus, or via right-click context
  menus.</p>

  <h2><a name="toolbox_display" id="toolbox_display">Displaying the
  Toolbox</a></h2>

  <p>The Toolbox is displayed on a "tab" in the <a href=
  "workspace.html#Right_Pane">Right Pane</a> of the Komodo
  workspace. It is displayed or hidden via any of the following
  methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>View|Tabs &amp; Sidebars|Toolbox</strong>: Use the
    <strong>View</strong> drop-down menu to modify Komodo's display
    characteristics.</li>

    <li><strong>Key Binding</strong>: The default key binding (in
    the default <a href=
    "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key binding</a>
    scheme) for opening and closing the Toolbox tab is
    'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'T'. See <a href=
    "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">Configuring Key
    Bindings</a> to alter or view the current key assignment.</li>

    <li><strong>Workspace Toolbar</strong>: If the Workspace
    Toolbar is displayed, click the "Show/Hide Right Pane" button.
    (Select <strong>View|Toolbars|Workspace</strong> to display the
    toolbar.) Alternatively, click the <strong>Show Specific Sidebar/Tab</strong> button
    and select <strong>Toolbox</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="toolbox_addcomp" id="toolbox_addcomp">Adding
  Components to the Toolbox</a></h2>

  <p>The Toolbox is an organizational container for frequently used
  "components". Components are items like files, folders, snippets,
  macros, etc. For information about individual components, refer
  to the relevant section of the documentation.</p>

  <p>Filesystem-based components consists of items that exist as
  entities on the disk: <a href=
  "files.html#files_top">files</a> and <a href=
  "templates.html#templates_top">templates</a>.
  Komodo-specific components exist only in Komodo, and are not
  stored as external disk entities. Komodo-specific components
  include <a href="openshort.html#openshort_top">open
  shortcuts</a>, <a href=
  "folders.html#folders_top">folders</a>, <a href=
  "snippets.html#snippets_top">snippets</a>, <a href=
  "run.html#run_top">run commands</a>, <a href=
  "urls.html#urls_top">URL shortcuts</a>, <a href=
  "macros.html#macros_top">macros</a> and <a href=
  "custtbi.html#custtbi_top">custom menus and
  toolbars</a>.</p>

  <p>Within the toolbox, filesytem-based components are merely
  references; they cannot be moved or deleted from within Komodo;
  moving them between projects and the Toolbox, or deleting them
  from projects or the Toolbox, has no effect on their actual
  disk-based location or their contents. On the other hand,
  Komodo-specific components do not exist outside of Komodo;
  therefore, they can be moved and copied (for example, from the
  Toolbox to the Projects sidebar) and deleted independently of the
  filesystem.</p>

  <p>For example, when a snippet (a Komodo-specific component) is
  copied from the Projects sidebar to the Toolbox, a new copy of the
  snippet is created; the original version still exists in the
  original location. Subsequent modifications of the snippet in the
  Toolbox do not change the version of the snippet stored in the
  Projects sidebar. On the other hand, when the contents of a file (a
  filesystem-based component) are changed, the changes apply
  regardless of the location from which the file is invoked.</p>

  <p>To add a component to the Toolbox:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Toolbox|Add</strong>: Use the
    <strong>Toolbox</strong> drop-down menu.</li>

    <li><strong>Toolbox|Add|<em>folder_name</em></strong>: When a
    folder name is selected in the Toolbox, the selected folder's
    name is also displayed on the <strong>Toolbox</strong>
    drop-down menu. Components can be added directly to that
    folder.</li>

    <li><strong>Add Button</strong>: Use the <strong>Add</strong>
    <img class="icon" src="img/projtb_add_butt.png" /> button on
    the <strong>Toolbox</strong> tab.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Drag and drop components
      from:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop-Aware Applications</strong>:
        Filenames can be dragged from drag-and-drop applications
        (such as Windows Explorer).</li>

        <li><strong>Projects or Toolbox sidebars</strong>: Components
        can be dragged between projects, the Toolbox and container
        components (such as folders).</li>

        <li><strong>Editor Filename Tabs</strong>: When a file is
        open in the Editor Pane, drag and drop from the tab that
        displays the filename to the Toolbox.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Import from Filesystem</strong>: Right-click a
    folder and select <strong><a href=
    "project.html#project_impcomp">Import from File
    System</a></strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Cut/Copy/Paste</strong>: All components have a
    right-click menu that includes the options
    <strong>Cut</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong> and
    <strong>Paste</strong>. Use these options to move components
    between projects, the Toolbox and container components (such as
    folders).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some components have special component-specific mechanisms for
  being added to projects. For example, snippets can be created and
  added to the Toolbox in one step by selecting a block of text in
  the Editor Pane and dragging it into the Toolbox. URL shortcuts
  are created by dragging and dropping a URL from a browser address
  bar or from the Editor Pane into the Toolbox. Refer to the
  specific component sections for more information about these
  options.</p>

  <p>To remove a component from the Toolbox, right-click the
  desired item and select <strong>Delete</strong>. Alternatively,
  click the desired component and press 'Delete', or right-click
  the component and select <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>

  <p>Komodo-specific components (run commands, macros, etc) are
  permanently deleted. Filesystem-based components (files, dialog
  boxes) are not; only the reference to the component within the
  project is removed.</p>

  <h2><a name="export_import" id="export_import">Exporting and
  Importing Toolbox Contents</a></h2>

  <p>The Toolbox has commands for exporting and importing the
  contents of the Toolbox as a package. Packages, which are stored
  with a ".kpz" extension, are compressed archive files, and can be
  opened by any archiving utility that supports <code>libz</code>
  (for example WinZip). The <strong>Export Package</strong> option
  differs from the <strong>Export as Project File</strong> option
  in that copies of filesystem-based components (such as files and
  dialog projects) are included in the archive. Conversely,
  <strong>Export as Project File</strong> creates a project with a
  reference to the component's original location and does not
  create copies of the components.</p>

  <p>Both Komodo-specific components (such as run commands and
  snippets) and filesystem-based components (such as files and
  dialog projects) can be included. The exported file can
  subsequently be loaded as a project or imported into the Toolbox.
  This provides a mechanism for sharing a Toolbox among multiple
  Komodo users; another mechanism is described in the "Shared
  Toolbox" section below.</p>

  <p>To export the contents of the Toolbox to a project file:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>From the <strong>Toolbox</strong> menu, select
    <strong>Export</strong>.</li>

    <li>In the <strong>Export Package</strong> dialog box, choose
    the destination directory and enter a filename.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To import a previously exported Toolbox:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>From the <strong>Toolbox</strong> menu, select
    <strong>Import</strong>.</li>

    <li>In the <strong>Import Package</strong> dialog box, select
    the project file containing the item(s) that you want to
    import.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="toolbox_share" id="toolbox_share">Sharing
  Toolboxes</a></h2>

  <p>A Shared Toolbox is a single Toolbox shared by multiple Komodo
  users. When a Shared Toolbox is enabled, a second sidebar called
  <strong>Shared Toolbox</strong> is available in the Right Pane. This
  sidebar displays the contents of the <code>toolbox.kpf</code> file,
  located in the Common Data Directory specified in Komodo's <a href=
  "prefs.html#Config_CDD">Shared Toolbox</a> preference.</p>

  <p>The functionality of the Shared Toolbox is determined by the
  user's access rights to the <code>toolbox.kpf</code> file. All
  users with "read" rights to the file are able to use items from
  the Toolbox. To prevent users from altering the shared toolbox,
  ensure that they only have "read" (and not "write") access to the
  file.</p>

  <p>The Shared Toolbox is populated by the same methods described
  in <a href="#toolbox_addcomp">Adding Components to the
  Toolbox</a>.</p>
