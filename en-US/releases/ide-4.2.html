including those that have been fixed in this release, or to
add comments or additional issues, please visit the
<a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/query.cgi?product=Komodo">Komodo
Bug Database</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="object_browser_issues" id="object_browser_issues">Object Browser</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Object Browser</strong> is currently
  being re-implemented using Komodo's new Code Intelligence
  backend and is not available in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="install_issues" id=
"install_issues">Installation &amp; Upgrade</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li> The auto-update from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1 will incorrectly indicate that
  the "Perl Dev Kit" and "Komodo DOM Viewer" extensions will not work and
  will be disabled. This is a false alarm. These extensions will continue
  to work after the update. (Bug 73060)</li>

  <li>When upgrading to a version of Komodo with a new
  <a href="../trouble.html#appdata_dir">application
  data directory</a> (i.e. 4.0.1 to 4.0.3 or 4.0.3 to 4.1),
  the usernames and passwords for <a href="../prefs.html#Servers">Remote
  Accounts</a> are not imported. These must be re-entered for each Server
  in the Server Preferences panel after the upgrade.</li>

  <li>Windows Vista will prompt you to either 'Allow' or
  'Deny' the installation. Click on 'Allow' and Komodo will
  install normally.</li>

  <li>Windows NT users may need to manually move their
  license file from
  <code>\WINNT\Profiles\[username]\ActiveState</code> to
  <code>\WINNT\Profiles\[username]\Application
  Data\ActiveState</code><br />
  (Bug 20203)</li>

  <li>If you upgraded your system from Win9x/WinME to
  WinNT/2K, ensure that your <code>ComSpec</code>
  environment variable is configured to
  <code>%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe</code> (for example,
  <code>C:\system32\cmd.exe</code>). There was a bug in the
  Microsoft Windows installer that did not update the
  variable from its original value of

  <li>The Komodo installer requires up to 230 MB in your
  TMP directory (as indicated by the value of your 'TMP'
  environment variable) during installation, even if you
  plan to install Komodo to another drive. If you do not
  have the required space on this drive, manually set the
  'TMP' environment variable to another directory with
  sufficient space. Ensure that you have enough space,
  temporarily, for installation. (Bug 7057)</li>

  <li>eTrust Antivirus Realtime Monitor and Komodo on
  Windows 9x: When RealMon is set to monitor outgoing files
  (or both incoming and outgoing files), Komodo's syntax
  checking doesn't function. (Bug 7741)</li>

  <li>On slow networks, users may notice performance
  degradation when editing files on network machines.
  Performance can be improved by disabling the Komodo
  function that checks if files on disk have changed. Use
  the <a href="../prefs.html#prefs_editor">Editor
  Preferences</a> to disable this feature. (Bug 18297)</li>

  <li>Interpolation shortcuts in snippets are not executed
  when the snippet is inserted in the Editor Pane via
  dragging and dropping.</li>

  <li>On Linux, GTK2 hard codes 'Ctrl'+'Shift' to use
  international input. Therefore, all key bindings
  involving 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+ (any valid hexadecimal
  character} do not work in Komodo. A workaround is to
  start Komodo with the command: <code>export
  GTK_IM_MODULE=xim; ./komodo'</code>. Otherwise, key
  bindings of this kind must be changed. (Bug 38205)</li>

  <li>When copying text that does not have Windows line
  endings into another application, which expects Windows
  line endings, the text may not retain the desired
  formatting. The text is often pasted as a single line.

<h3><a name="Debugging_Issues" id=
"Debugging_Issues">Debugging</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tcl 8.5</strong>: Tcl Beta releases contain
  only version-specific executables (e.g.
  <code>tclsh85.exe</code> and <code>wish85.exe</code>).
  Komodo does not automatically find these in the path. To
  use them, specify the executables manually in
  <strong>Edit|Preferences...|Languages|Tcl|Interpreters</strong>,
  or create non-versioned symlinks/shortcuts to the
  versioned executables.</li>

  <li>The Perl debugger uses <code>alarm()</code>
  internally. This can conflict with some Perl frameworks
  and modules (such as <acronym title=
  "Perl Object Environment">POE</acronym>) which use
  <code>alarm()</code> as well. To work around this
  problem, add <code>alarm=0</code> to the
  <code>PERLDB_OPTS</code> environment variable (in the
  Environment tab of the Debugger Options) which stops the
  debugger from using <code>alarm()</code>. With this
  work-around in place, the Break Now button and menu item
  will not work in debugging sessions.</li>

  <li>Using the JavaScript debugger on files with mapped
  URIs can yield confusing results. Komodo will open the
  mapped source file rather than querying Firefox for the
  runtime JavaScript.</li>

  <li>Python debugging with IronPython does not currently
  work as there is no support for Python debugging hooks in
  IronPython.</li>

  <li>In PerlApp executables, it is now possible to step
  into loaded modules, but not to set breakpoints in
  them.</li>

  <li>The Komodo JavaScript Debugger is incompatible with
  the <a href=
  "https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/">FireBug</a>
  Firefox extension. FireBug must be manually disabled
  (Tools|Firebug|Disable Firebug) for the JavaScript
  debugger to work. (Bug 47208)</li>

  <li>PHP 5.0.0, 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 do not work with the
  debugger extension. Use PHP versions 4.3.10 or greater,
  or 5.0.3 or greater, including 5.1.</li>

  <li>If the debug listener (<strong>Debug|Listen for
  Debugger Connections</strong>) is off, multithreaded
  applications may not run or debug as expected. Only the
  main thread operates through the debugger. To debug
  multithreaded applications, turn on debug listening prior
  to debugging. (Debug listening is turned on by default.)
  (Bug 32776)</li>

  <li>PHP configurations that use Zend Extensions (such as
  PHP Accelerator) are not compatible with the Komodo PHP
  debugger. (Bug 21890)</li>

  <li>Due to the way the core Perl interpreter works, it is
  not possible to step over "require" statements. (Bug
  18776)</li>

  <li>You cannot debug 'freestanding' executables created
  with the PDK in Komodo. Instead, build a 'dependant'
  executable, which requires a local install of
  ActivePerl.</li>

  <li>The variable watcher does not work when debugging
  <code><em>\\machine\d$\path\to\perl_script.pl</em></code>.
  It does work when opening the same file via a UNC path
  that does not include a '$' character. (Bug 19558)</li>

  <li>When debugging remote applications, Komodo fails if
  the remote process does not have valid stdout and stderr
  handles. GUI applications, such as those started with
  "wperl.exe" or "pythonw.exe", or those using the
  Pythonwin or wxPython frameworks, or those with certain
  embedded applications, can have invalid stdout and stderr
  handles. Until we resolve this issue, try to run and
  debug your remote program under perl.exe or
  python.exe.</li>

  <li>Python, XSLT and PHP debugging require TCP/IP to be
  installed and properly configured, even if you are
  debugging scripts locally. While TCP/IP is configured by
  default on most systems, early versions of Windows may
  require manual TCP/IP configuration.</li>

  <li>When debugging a GUI script in Komodo, adding a
  "watched variable" when <i>not</i> stopped at a
  breakpoint can cause Komodo to hang. You must manually
  terminate the script being debugged to stop Komodo from
  hanging. The problem occurs because the GUI script, while
  in its message loop, does not respond to Komodo's request
  for the variable value. (Bug 23516)</li>

  <li>If the Komodo debugger is configured to use a
  specific port, when Komodo is shut down, the port is
  sometimes not immediately released. If Komodo is
  restarted before the port is released by the operating
  system, a message is displayed advising that the system
  is unable to bind that port. As a workaround, we suggest
  configuring port 0 as the Komodo debugging port and using
  the debugger proxy for remote debugging. (Bug 32821)</li>

  <li>Breaking into a running Perl script can only occur
  while crossing sub boundaries in the Perl code, as that's
  currently the only chance the Perl debugger has to check
  to see if the IDE has sent the break command. (Bug
  35611)</li>

  <li>When debugging Perl, if you set a breakpoint on the
  <code>while</code> statement, the debugger stops on the
  breakpoint only once, namely before the first pass
  through the loop. This is a limitation in the Perl
  interpreter. (Bug 34866)</li>

  <li>Komodo debugger uses TCP/IP networking for
  communications. On systems with firewalls installed, the
  debugger may fail if the firewall is not configured to
  allow Komodo to listen for connections. On Windows, you
  may see a "Windows Security Alert" dialog asking if you
  want to allow Komodo to listen for connections, you will
  need to unblock Komodo. (Bug 21684)</li>

  <li>The Perl debugger cannot trap fatal runtime errors.
  Users can accomplish this in their code by wrapping
  problematic code in an <code>eval</code> block, and then
  testing for an exception. (Bug 33855)</li>

  <li>Komodo does not provide proper source debugging in
  Python <code>exec</code> and <code>eval</code>
  statements. This is a limitation of Python's interpreter.
  (Bug 40336)</li>

  <li>When debugging PHP on a remote Linux machine from a
  local Windows machine, the debugging option "Try to find
  files on the local system when remote debugging" has no
  effect. This is due to differences in Unix and Win32 file
  paths. (Bug 39137)</li>

  <li>When debugging Python, Komodo does not permit you to
  set local variables in the interactive shell. However,
  you can edit those values from the program's variable
  viewers, such as the <strong>Watch</strong> and
  <strong>Locals</strong> panes on the
  <strong>Debug</strong> tab. (Bug 36794)</li>

  <li>When debugging PHP scripts on Komodo with CGI
  emulation, you may need to change the setting for
  <code>cgi.force_redirect</code> in the <em>php.ini</em>
  file. You may also need to set an environment variable in
  the Debugger Options dialog box: "REDIRECT_STATUS=200
  OK". These settings vary depending on your system and the
  configuration of PHP. (Bug 35021)</li>

  <li>When Debugging PHP, the <strong>HTML</strong> pane of
  the <strong>Output</strong> tab does not refresh
  automatically. To refresh the contents of this pane,
  click the "Reload HTML view" button on the
  <strong>Output</strong> tab. (Bug 36999)</li>

  <li>Komodo supports full Unicode debugging with Perl 5.8.
  Although Perl 5.6 can be used for debugging programs with
  single-byte encodings (e.g. cp1251), it is recommended
  that programmers with multi-byte character sets upgrade
  to Perl 5.8.5 or better. (Bug 36760)</li>

  <li>When debugging Python, if you launch the debugger
  from a directory containing a module with the same name
  as one of the modules used by the debugger, the wrong
  file is used. For example, if you have a file named
  <em>logging.py</em> in the directory where the debugger
  is launched, the debugger will fail. (Bug 36783)</li>

  <li>When stepping through Perl files, the Komodo debugger
  displays the wrong print results in the
  <strong>Locals</strong> window of the
  <strong>Debug</strong> tab. This is because Perl provides
  only one iterator for each collection variable. The
  Komodo debugger must iterate through a hash or an array
  in order to display the values in Komodo. A workaround is
  to display the <strong>Watch</strong> pane instead of the
  <strong>Locals</strong> pane, and type the names of the
  expressions that you want to view. (Bug 33668)</li>

<h3><a name="Source_Code_Control_Issues" id=
"Source_Code_Control_Issues">Source Code Control</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>A bug in CVS will cause WinCVS and TortoiseCVS to
  detect file changes when a Komodo project has merely been
  opened. The problem is likely a bug in the cvshome.org
  executable or in the cvsnt.org executable, which are used
  by both WinCVS and TortoiseCVS. (Bug 21085)</li>

  <li>Komodo's integration with the Perforce commit/submit
  command cannot commit files that are not in the default
  changelist. These files must be submitted via an external
  interface (e.g. p4, P4Win). Note that any files checked
  out inside Komodo are in the default changelist, so this
  limitation should only apply to users who already use an
  external interface to their Perforce repository. (Bug
  27070)</li>

  <li>If the Perforce connection cannot be established,
  checking the status of files in a Perforce repository
  will hang Komodo. (Bug 35058)</li>

  <li>If you are using CVS Source Code Control, note that
  the very first time you log in to a repository, cvs.exe
  fails to create the .cvspass file correctly and will
  return an error. Repeat the command to login a second
  time and correctly generate the file. This is a CVS bug.
  (Bug 20353)</li>

  <li>If you are using CVS Source Code Control on Windows
  98 or Me, the environment variables
  <code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and <code>HOMEPATH</code> must be

  <li>Display of text during editing ("painting") may
  sometimes be slow or pause momentarily.</li>

  <li>Certain UI elements stop working after changing key

  <li>Komodo is sometimes recognized as a web browser by
  some applications on OS X (e.g. Safari's "Default Web
  Browser" setting). Using Komodo as the default web
  browser is not recommended.</li>

  <li>Application menu items that have multi-key key
  bindings will not show their key bindings in a pop-up
  tool tip on OS X. This is a limitation in OS X.</li>

  <li>Context menus may not display unless you hold down
  the mouse button for a period of time. This is because
  the Komodo editor is implemented in Mozilla as a plugin,
  and it does not access the apropriate context menu event
  to handle this behaviour properly without interfering
  with other mouse events (for example, drag and drop).
  (Bug 41216)</li>

  <li>Due to a limitation in the Mozilla code base, key
  bindings for the <strong>Next File</strong> and
  <strong>Previous File</strong> options on the
  <strong>Window</strong> menu are not displayed next to
  the menu items. The key bindings are 'Cmd'+'PageDown' to
  view the next file and 'Cmd'+'PageUp' to view the

  (Bug 33817)</li>

  <li>The <strong>Fonts and Colors</strong> pane in the
  Preferences dialog box displays the same list of fonts in
  both the Fixed and Proportional lists. There is no
  programmatic way to identify whether a font is
  proportional or not on GTK; therefore, users must know
  the properties of the individual fonts when modifying
  these values. (Bug 27206)</li>

  <li>If the GTK theme is changed while Komodo is running,
  Komodo will not change the menu/toolbar font colors,
  causing usability problems in extreme cases. (Bug
  34508)</li>

  <li>Install Komodo into a directory path that only
  includes alphanumeric characters. Komodo is known to have
  trouble with paths that include spaces and some
  non-alphanumeric characters.</li>

  <li>Filenames or paths containing non-ASCII characters
  cannot be opened remotely.</li>

  <li>Key bindings defined in the window manager (such as
  KDE) take precedence over Komodo key bindings. In the
  case of conflicts, you must either change the Komodo key
  bindings or the window manager key bindings. (Bug
  30926)</li>

  <li>You cannot move an existing Komodo installation to a
  new directory. You must uninstall Komodo from the
  existing location and reinstall it in the new location.

  <li>Red Hat Linux 9.0 is known to have threading library
  bugs in its glibc that may cause Komodo to hang in
  certain situations. The recommended solution is to
  upgrade to the latest glibc for Red Hat Linux 9.0. (Bug
  24340)</li>

  <li>Using colon-separated include paths in the Perl
  shebang line causes a parse failure on some versions of
  Perl. Instead of using "/usr/bin/perl -cwT

  <li>Komodo may not start up correctly on some Linux
  systems if C++ compatibility libraries have not been
  installed. On Fedora and Red Hat systems, install the
  "compat-libstdc++" package. On SuSE, install the "compat"

  <li>When using the PDK <strong>Build Standalone
  Application</strong> feature in Komodo with Perl 5.8.0 on
  a Linux installation where the environment is set to use
  UTF-8, you must add a module 'utf8' on the modules tab.

  is unable to open files or paths that contain character
  sets that are not in the systems locale. (Bug 33304)</li>

  <li>A newly created custom menu is added to the Toolbox
  but is not immediately displayed alongside existing
  toolbars. Restarting Komodo causes the new toolbar to
  display. (Bug 40078)</li>
