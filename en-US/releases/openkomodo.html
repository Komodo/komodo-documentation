<h2 id="knownissues">Known Issues</h2>

    <p>To view the status of outstanding Open Komodo issues, including those
    that have been fixed in this release, or to add comments or additional
    issues, please visit <a class="doc"
    href="http://bugs.ActiveState.com/">http://bugs.activestate.com</a>. Open
    Komodo inherits the following known issues from Komodo Edit:</p>

    <h3><a name="install_issues" id=
    "install_issues">Installation &amp; Upgrade</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>When upgrading to a version of Komodo with a new
      <a href="komodo-doc-trouble.html#appdata_dir">application
      data directory</a> (i.e. 4.0.1 to 4.0.3 or 4.0.3 to 4.1),
      the usernames and passwords for <a href=
      "komodo-doc-prefs.html#Servers">Remote Accounts</a> are
      not imported. These must be re-entered for each Server in
      the Server Preferences panel after the upgrade.</li>

      <li>Windows Vista will prompt you to either 'Allow' or
      'Deny' the installation. Click on 'Allow' and Komodo will
      install normally.</li>

      <li>The Komodo installer requires up to 230 MB in your
      TMP directory (as indicated by the value of your 'TMP'
      environment variable) during installation, even if you
      plan to install Komodo to another drive. If you do not
      have the required space on this drive, manually set the
      'TMP' environment variable to another directory with
      sufficient space. Ensure that you have enough space,
      temporarily, for installation. (Bug 7057)</li>

      <li>If you try to install Komodo on Windows and the MSI
      install fails with error 2355, your MSI file is corrupt.
      Please download Komodo again and re-run the MSI install.
      (Bug 7405)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Startup_Issues" id=
    "Startup_Issues">Startup</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The first time Komodo is run after installation, it
      must register a number of components with the operating
      system. This causes the first launch to be considerably
      slower than subsequent launches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Editing_Issues" id=
    "Editing_Issues">Editing</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The line and column cursor coordinates in the status
      bar are not updated while the cursor is moving.</li>

      <li>The macro recorder will record events that it cannot
      handle, such as the opening of dialogs. The only dialog
      that can be opened via a macro is the Find dialog; other
      dialogs will cause the macro to stop.</li>

      <li>Languages that are read right to left and Asian
      languages are not supported. All Latin and Cyrillic
      languages are fully supported. (Bug 29702)</li>

      <li>On slow networks, users may notice performance
      degradation when editing files on network machines.
      Performance can be improved by disabling the Komodo
      function that checks if files on disk have changed. Use
      the <a href="komodo-doc-prefs.html#prefs_editor">Editor
      Preferences</a> to disable this feature. (Bug 18297)</li>

      <li>Interpolation shortcuts in snippets are not executed
      when the snippet is inserted in the Editor Pane via
      dragging and dropping.</li>

      <li>On Linux, GTK2 hard codes 'Ctrl'+'Shift' to use
      international input. Therefore, all key bindings
      involving 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+ (any valid hexadecimal
      character} do not work in Komodo. A workaround is to
      start Komodo with the command: <code>export
      GTK_IM_MODULE=xim; ./komodo'</code>. Otherwise, key
      bindings of this kind must be changed. (Bug 38205)</li>

      <li>When copying text that does not have Windows line
      endings into another application, which expects Windows
      line endings, the text may not retain the desired
      formatting. The text is often pasted as a single line.
      (Bug 36791)</li>

      <li>Code snippets that are 8-bit-encoded and contain
      high-bit characters may have the wrong encoding (or no
      encoding) when inserted from the Toolbox into a UTF-8
      encoded file in the Editor Pane. (Bug 36769)</li>

      <li>When editing a code comment in Komodo you may use
      &lt;Shift+Enter&gt; to start a new line <em>within</em>
      the comment -- the comment prefix is added automatically.
      Komodo may fail to properly add the comment prefix if
      many new lines are added quickly with repeated
      &lt;Shift+Enter&gt; presses. (Bug 38658)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="OSX_Issues" id="OSX_Issues">Mac OS X</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>If you have two drives with the same name, and you
      use the file open dialog in a mozilla application, the
      directory menu (top middle of dialog) may crash when
      clicked. To avoid this, rename one of the hard
      drives.</li>

      <li>New Custom Menus created in a Project or in the
      Toolbox will not appear until Komodo has been
      restared.</li>

      <li>Throughout the Komodo documentation there are
      references to key bindings that use the 'Meta' key. This
      key may be better known to OS X users as the 'Command'
      key. (Bug 41959)</li>

      <li>Komodo will shut down and restart itself the first
      time it is run after installation. (Bug 40143)</li>

      <li>Display of text during editing ("painting") may
      sometimes be slow or pause momentarily.</li>

      <li>Certain UI elements stop working after changing key
      bindings. Restarting Komodo fixes this. (Bug 38683)</li>

      <li>When saving a file, Komodo does not set file
      information (type and creator) for the OS X Finder to
      know that Komodo created the file. (Bug 38745)</li>

      <li>Komodo is sometimes recognized as a web browser by
      some applications on OS X (e.g. Safari's "Default Web
      Browser" setting). Using Komodo as the default web
      browser is not recommended.</li>

      <li>Application menu items that have multi-key key
      bindings will not show their key bindings in a pop-up
      tool tip on OS X. This is a limitation in OS X.</li>

      <li>Context menus may not display unless you hold down
      the mouse button for a period of time. This is because
      the Komodo editor is implemented in Mozilla as a plugin,
      and it does not access the apropriate context menu event
      to handle this behaviour properly without interfering
      with other mouse events (for example, drag and drop).
      (Bug 41216)</li>

      <li>Due to a limitation in the Mozilla code base, key
      bindings for the <strong>Next File</strong> and
      <strong>Previous File</strong> options on the
      <strong>Window</strong> menu are not displayed next to
      the menu items. The key bindings are 'Meta'+'PageDown' to
      view the next file and 'Meta'+'PageUp' to view the
      previous file. (Bug 40716)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Linux_Issues" id="Linux_Issues">Linux</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>When closing any Komodo window that contains an
      editor component, a GLIB error entry will appear in the
      log files (or terminal if Komodo was started from one).
      This error can be safely ignored. A patch was submitted
      by the Mozilla group to the Gnome group that handles this
      error, and should be available in GTK 2.4 or higher. The
      patch can be viewed at
      http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=128546<br />
      (Bug 33817)</li>

      <li>The <strong>Fonts and Colors</strong> pane in the
      Preferences dialog box displays the same list of fonts in
      both the Fixed and Proportional lists. There is no
      programmatic way to identify whether a font is
      proportional or not on GTK; therefore, users must know
      the properties of the individual fonts when modifying
      these values. (Bug 27206)</li>

      <li>If the GTK theme is changed while Komodo is running,
      Komodo will not change the menu/toolbar font colors,
      causing usability problems in extreme cases. (Bug
      34508)</li>

      <li>Install Komodo into a directory path that only
      includes alphanumeric characters. Komodo is known to have
      trouble with paths that include spaces and some
      non-alphanumeric characters.</li>

      <li>Filenames or paths containing non-ASCII characters
      cannot be opened remotely.</li>

      <li>Key bindings defined in the window manager (such as
      KDE) take precedence over Komodo key bindings. In the
      case of conflicts, you must either change the Komodo key
      bindings or the window manager key bindings. (Bug
      30926)</li>

      <li>You cannot move an existing Komodo installation to a
      new directory. You must uninstall Komodo from the
      existing location and reinstall it in the new location.
      (Bug 19478)</li>

      <li>Red Hat Linux 9.0 is known to have threading library
      bugs in its glibc that may cause Komodo to hang in
      certain situations. The recommended solution is to
      upgrade to the latest glibc for Red Hat Linux 9.0. (Bug
      24340)</li>

      <li>Komodo may not start up correctly on some Linux
      systems if C++ compatibility libraries have not been
      installed. On Fedora and Red Hat systems, install the
      "compat-libstdc++" package. On SuSE, install the "compat"
      package. On Gentoo, as root, run <code>emerge
      lib-compat</code>. This is not thought to be a problem on
      Debian systems. (Bug 36244)</li>

      <li>Komodo will work on Debian/Ubuntu AMD64 with some
      manual configuration (some libraries were not properly
      ported to support 32-bit applications). (Bug 41368) Run
      Komodo from a shell script which sets certain environment
      variables:
        <pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
export GTK_PATH=/usr/lib32/gtk-2.0/
export PANGO_RC_FILE=/etc/pango32/pangorc
komodo
</pre>The <code>pangorc</code> file should contain the following:
        <pre class="code">
[Pango]
ModuleFiles=/etc/pango32/pango.modules
[PangoX]
AliasFiles=/etc/pango/pangox.aliases
</pre>More information on running 32 bit Mozilla applications on
AMD64 can be found <a href=
"http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=84732">here</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="Other_Issues" id="Other_Issues">Other</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>A limitation in the parser used by the DOM Viewer
      causes HTML elements embedded in JavaScript strings to
      appear as element nodes of the current document. Placing
      the JavaScript in a CDATA section or a comment avoids
      this problem.</li>

      <li>Komodo inherits a Mozilla bug whereby certain video
      drivers on Windows cause Komodo to crash. If you
      experience this behavior, upgrade your video driver to
      the latest version. If the problem persists, reduce the
      color definition assigned to the driver (<strong>Control
      Panel|Display|Settings</strong>). (Bug 32746)</li>

      <li>Komodo inherits a <a href=
      "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230512">Mozilla
      bug</a> regarding display on dual-monitor systems where
      the secondary monitor is to the left of the primary
      monitor (causing negative coordinate results). The Komodo
      display occasionally fails to refresh; Komodo must be
      stopped and restarted to fix the display (Bug 26852)</li>

      <li>When using Komodo's Preview in Browser feature, users
      running Mozilla on Windows XP Pro, Windows 2000 Pro and
      Windows 98 may find that they cannot exit Komodo if
      Mozilla is still open. If this should occur, close all
      open browser windows before exiting Komodo. (Bug
      26431)</li>

      <li>The Palm Desktop for Windows software makes exclusive
      use of the 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'T' key combination, thus
      making this combination unavailable in Komodo. (Bug
      27851)</li>

      <li>On Windows NT, some interactive commands may not work
      properly when run from the <strong>Command
      Output</strong> tab of the Output Pane. You must run
      these commands in a separate shell. (Bug 23176)</li>

      <li>In file picker dialogs that display a list of files,
      when "All files" is specified, files that begin with a
      period are not displayed (Bug 18712)</li>

      <li>The Output tab cuts off lines at 250 characters. (Bug
      20711)</li>

      <li>Macros will not record certain commands, including
      (but possibly not limited to)
      'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'B'|'R'|'E'|'D' (toggle toolbars or button
      text), 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'N' (new default file), and View as
      Language menu items.</li>

      <li>Users of the Japanese version of Windows XP may
      experience difficulties in starting Komodo.</li>

      <li>The <strong>Open</strong> field in the Open/Find
      Toolbar does not automatically display a drop-down list
      of directories when an UNC path is typed. Currently, the
      list is only displayed when a the path includes a
      subdirectory. (Bug 29011)</li>

      <li>When adding new key bindings via the Preferences
      dialog box, Komodo displays a message indicating that the
      key bindings will not take effect until Komodo is
      restarted. However, some changes do take effect
      immediately.(Bug 36710)</li>

      <li>"Find" macros do not work because incorrect code is
      recorded. (Bug 36332)</li>

      <li>If you rename a folder that was added to a custom
      menu, the name is changed in Komodo's Toolbox but not on
      the menu itself. A workaround is to move the renamed
      folder out and then back into the associated custom menu
      icon in the Toolbox. (Bug 36679)</li>

      <li>The Mozilla code base currently does not support the
      Windows Unicode binary. As a result, Komodo for Windows
      is unable to open files or paths that contain character
      sets that are not in the systems locale. (Bug 33304)</li>

      <li>A newly created custom menu is added to the Toolbox
      but is not immediately displayed alongside existing
      toolbars. Restarting Komodo causes the new toolbar to
      display. (Bug 40078)</li>
    </ul>
