Reporting Bugs

If you have found a bug, we'd like to know about it. First, view our on-line bug

issue, you can submit a bug report.

To view our bug database and submit a bug report:

    or
    From the Komodo Workspace, go to the Help menu and select Komodo Bug
    Database.
 2. Click View Bugs. You can apply filters and then sort the result by column.
 3. If necessary, click Search and enter a keyword for your bug.
 4. If you can't see your bug, click Submit a bug.
 5. Complete the on-line form with as much detail as possible. This helps us
    identify the problem.
 6. Click Submit Bug Report.
    If you make a mistake, click Reset.

Your bug will be assigned an ID and you can monitor the progress of your bug on
this Web site. We will email you when your bug is resolved.
