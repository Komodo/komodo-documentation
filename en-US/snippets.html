  <p>Snippets are frequently used strings that can be quickly
  inserted into the current document. For example, repetitive
  sections of code or standard comments can be stored within a
  snippet. Snippets have advanced properties; they support the use
  of <a href="tabstops.html#tabstops_top">Tabstops</a>
  and <a href=
  "shortcuts.html#shortcuts_top">Interpolation
  Shortcuts</a>, can be assigned to <a href=
  "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">Key Bindings</a> and associated with
  abbreviations, and allow for the specification of indentation context and cursor
  position.</p>

  <p>Snippets are stored in the
  <a href="toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="snippets_creating" id="snippets_creating">Creating
  Snippets</a></h2>

  <p>To create a code snippet, select the desired block of text in
  the Editor Pane. Then drag and drop the selected section onto the
  <a href="toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> tab.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, select the desired text, then right-click and
  select <strong>Add as Snippet in the Toolbox</strong>.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, right-click a folder in the Toolbox, and
  select <strong>New Snippet</strong>. If you use this method, you
  must manually enter the contents of the snippet; text selected in
  the Editor Pane is not automatically added to the Snippet dialog
  box.</p>

  <h2><a name="snippets_config" id="snippets_config">Configuring
  Snippets</a></h2>

  <p>To configure snippet properties, right-click the snippet on
  either the <a class="doc" href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> tab, and
  select <strong>Properties</strong>. The following configuration
  properties are available:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Snippet Name</strong>: Enter the text that should
    display in the Toolbox for this code snippet.
    If the snippet was created by dragging a text selection from
    the Editor Pane, the snippet is named after the text in the
    snippet.</li>

    <li><strong>Snippet Contents</strong>: If the snippet was
    created by dragging a text selection from the Editor Pane, the
    contents of the selected text are displayed in the Snippet
    Contents field. Otherwise, enter the contents of the snippet
    manually. Add or edit snippet content as desired.<p>Snippet contents can
    also be edited in the standard Komodo editor by right-clicking on a snippet
    and choosing the <code>Edit Snippet</code> menu item.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Snippet Shortcuts</strong>: Add <a class="doc"
    href="shortcuts.html#shortcuts_top">Interpolation
    Shortcuts</a> or <a class="doc" href=
    "tabstops.html#tabstops_top">Tabstops</a>
    to a snippet by clicking the arrow button to the right
    of the Snippets Contents field, and selecting a shortcut from
    the drop-down menu. Interpolation shortcuts in snippets are not
    executed when the snippet is inserted in the Editor Pane via
    dragging and dropping.</li>

    <li><strong>Maintain selected text or cursor position after
    insertion</strong>: Within the snippet contents field, either
    select a portion of the snippet (by dragging the mouse pointer
    over the desired selection) or position the editing cursor
    within the string. If this check box is selected, when the
    snippet is inserted into the Editor Pane, the selected text or
    the cursor position is displayed in the same manner.</li>

    <li><strong>Maintain indentation context after
    insertion</strong>: If the snippet is inserted into the Editor
    Pane when the editing cursor is in an indented position, select
    this check box to use the indentation point as an indentation
    "prefix". The indentation structure of the snippet is preserved
    at the position of insertion.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Auto-Abbreviation</strong>: Check this if the snippet can be
    inserted immediately after the name of the snippet is typed, followed by a
    recognized trigger character (see <a
    href="#snippets_auto_abbreviations">blahAuto-Abbreviations</a> for more
    details).
  </ul>
  
  <h3><a name="conditional_snippets" id="conditional_snippets">Conditional
  Snippets</h3>
  
  <p>Komodo supports the use of EJS (Embedded JavaScript) syntax to add a
  further dynamic dimension to snippets, beyond those offered by the supplied
  <a href= "shortcuts.html#shortcuts_top">Interpolation Shortcuts</a>. EJS is
  similar to other template languages like PHP or RHTML, combining controlling
  code (e.g. "if" tests), dynamic code (results of JavaScript expressions that
  get inserted into the snippet), as well as the static part of the snippet.</p>
  
  <p>EJS syntax is very simple: Anything between "&lt;%" and "%&gt;" is
  control code, to be evaluated to determine which code of a snippet is finally
  inserted. Anything between "&lt;%=" and "%&gt;" is evaluated and inserted into
  the snippet. If the EJS pass over a snippet throws an exception, either due to
  a JavaScript syntax-error or having JS code deliberately throw an exception,
  snippet insertion stops.</p>
  
  <p>This simple example might suffice. Suppose you want a snippet to insert
  the current month (by 0-based number) if the current second is odd,
  and the current date if it's even. Here's what the snippet would look
  like:</p>
  
  <pre>
Current date part: &lt;% var m = new Date();
if (m.getSeconds() % 2) { /* It's odd */ %>
Month: &lt;%= m.getMonth() %>
&lt;% } else { %>
Date: &lt;%= m.getDate() %>
&lt;% } %>  </pre>
  
  <p>The first block of JavaScript declares the <code>m</code> variable, sets it
  to the current date, and also tests to see if the current second count is
  even. The second JS block inserts the date object's month into the text flow.
  The third JS block starts the 'else' part. The fourth inserts the date
  object's date. And the final JS block just ends the if-else block. You can
  even have loops inside snippets, not just if-blocks.</p>
  
  <p>This feature makes snippets more "macro-like". But note that while you
  could implement this snippet with a macro, the main difference between
  snippets with EJS, and macros, is that with snippets there's no need to work
  with the editor object, views, current positions, and
  selections: snippets handle all that processing automatically.</p>
  
  <p>Conditional snippets are pickier about white-space than other template
  languages that generate HTML, mainly because most such generated white-space
  in HTML doesn't get rendered. But because here the snippets are generating
  text for your editor, you might find extra whitespace in the expansion. Note
  as well that it's better to use "/* ... */" comments in the JavaScript code,
  because the evaluator does modify newlines, meaning that a comment might not
  end where you think it should. This is no different from how slash-star
  comments are preferred in handler attribute values in HTML.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="snippet_helper_library" id="snippet_helper_library">Snippet
  Helper Functions</h3>
  <p>While rewriting some of the language service code as dynamic snippets, we
  found we were using some code repeatedly. This code was refactored into
  functions added to the <code>ko.snippets</code> namespace. These currently
  include the following functions:</p>
  
  <dl>
    <dt><code>RejectedSnippet(message, ex=null)</code></dt>
    <dd>If a snippet throws an instance of
    <code>ko.snippets.RejectedSnippet</code>, this signals to the code that the
    EJS code deliberately suppressed inserting this snippet (see <a
    href="#new_snippets">New Snippets</a> for an example).</dd>
    
    <dt><code>ko.snippets.rightOfFirstRubyKeyword()</code></dt>
    <dd>In Ruby, keywords like "if" can start a block when they start an
    expression, but not when used after an expression. This boolean
    function makes that check.</dd>
    
    <dt><code>ko.snippets.inPythonClass()</code></dt>
    <dd>This function returns true if we're currently defining a class in Python
    code.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  
  <p>This list is expected to expand with time, or even get merged with other
  high-level APIs. You can easily add more code to this namespace with a
  startup-trigger macro (or less easily, by writing an extension).
  
  <h3><a name="linting_snippets" id="linting_snippets">Syntax-Checking
  Snippets</h3>
  
  <p>Now that snippets can include code, it's natural to ask if Komodo can do
  syntax-checking on snippets. The answer, of course, is "yes". When a snippet's
  contents are edited in a regular window, Komodo assigns the snippet to the
  "Komodo Snippet" language. This language colors the EJS and JavaScript parts
  appropriately, treating the rest as plain text. And it looks for missing
  "%&gt;" tag (EJS allows and ignores "%&gt;" sequences that don't occur after
  a "&lt;%" tag, and similarly ignores any "&lt;%" sequences that occur after
  a "&lt;%" tag but before a closing "%&gt;" tag.</p>
  
  <p>Any file ending with ".snippet" will also be treated as an instance of the
  "Komodo Snippet" language by default.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="new_snippets" id="new_snippets">New Snippets</h3>
  
  <p>Many of the language folders in the <code>Abbreviations</code> folder in
  the toolbox now have a folder called "keywords". Much of the smart processing
  on those keywords has been moved from the language-service files written in
  Python into these snippets. For example, all of the structural Ruby keywords
  now have associated snippets in
  <code>Samples/Abbreviations/Ruby/keywords</code>, and are set to be
  auto-abbreviation, meaning they will be automatically triggered after their
  name is typed in appropriate contexts (so no expansion occurs when, for
  example, "if" is typed in a string or comment). These keywords are also a good
  resource, to see how to write dynamic snippets by example.</p>

  <h2><a name="snippets_using" id="snippets_using">Using
  Snippets</a></h2>

  <p>To insert the contents of a snippet at the current cursor
  position in the Editor Pane, double-click it, or right-click the
  snippet and select <strong>Insert Snippet</strong>.</p>

  <p>Although you can also drag and drop snippets onto the Editor
  Pane, the cursor position and indentation check box options
  explained above in <a class="doc" href=
  "#snippets_config">Configuring Snippets</a> will only take effect
  if the snippet is added using the double-click or <strong>Insert
  Snippet</strong> method.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="snippets_abbreviations">Abbreviations</a></h3>
  
  <p>Snippets saved in a toolbox folder called
  "Abbreviations" (or a language-specific sub-directory) can be inserted
  by typing the snippet name in the buffer. See <a
  href="abbreviations.html">Abbreviations</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="snippets_auto_abbreviations">Auto-Abbreviations</a></h3>
  <p>If a snippet is marked as an "Auto Abbreviation", then any occurrence of
  its name will automatically be expanded after the name is followed by a valid
  trigger character.</p>
  
  <p>The trigger characters are defined in <code>Preferences / Editor / Smart
  Editing/ Auto-Abbreviations</code>. Use the standard JavaScript "\" escaping
  to describe tabs, newlines and carriage returns (both work the same), and any
  non-printable characters using standard "\x" and "\u" notation. Note that
  auto-abbreviation can be controlled globally or per-snippet. Also, it's
  usually convenient to include Space as a trigger character, but this isn't
  always desired. Pressing
  Shift-Space after an abbreviation suppresses its expansion.</p>
  
  <h3><a name="abbreviation_case">Abbreviations and Case</a></h3>
  <p>Auto-abbreviations much match the case of the snippet's name. Komodo
  currently will ignore case when matching snippets during explicit abbreviation
  expansion (invoked by default by the Ctrl-T|Cmd-T sequence), but will favor matching
  a snippet where the case does match over one where the match occurs only when
  case is ignored.
  
  <h2><a name="snippets_options" id="snippets_options">Snippet
  Options</a></h2>

  <p>To access options for the selected snippet, right-click a snippet
  in the Toolbox and select the desired option.</p>

  <p>The following options are available:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Insert Snippet</strong>: Use this option to insert
    the snippet at the current cursor position in the editor, as
    described above in <a href="#snippets_using">Using
    Snippets</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Cut/Copy/Paste</strong>: Used to duplicate or move a
    snippet when dragging is not convenient (e.g. to a folder which is
    currently closed).</li>

    <li><strong>Show in File Manager</strong>: Shows the JSON file for
    the snippet in the system's default file manager.</li>

    <li><strong>Export as Zip File...</strong>: Exports the snippet in a
    standard ".zip" archive.</li>

    <li><strong>Rename</strong>: Changes the snippet name.</li>

    <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Permanently removes the selected
    snippet from the toolbox.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="snippets_properties" id=
  "snippets_properties">Snippet Properties</a></h3>

  <p>Snippet properties are used to alter or rename snippets (as
  described in <a href="#snippets_config">Configuring Snippets</a>,
  above). The Properties dialog box is also used to assign a custom
  icon to a snippet or to assign a custom key binding. To access
  the Properties dialog box, right-click the snippet and select
  <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>

  <h4><a name="snippets_Cust_Icons" id=
  "snippets_Cust_Icons">Assigning Custom Icons to Snippets</a></h4>

  <p>The default snippet icons can be replaced with custom icons.
  Komodo includes more than 600 icons; alternatively, select a
  custom image stored on a local or network drive (use 16x16-pixel
  images for best results).</p>

  <p>To assign a custom icon to a snippet:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the Toolbox sidebar, right-click the desired
    snippet and select <strong>Properties</strong>. Alternatively,
    click the icon in the Toolbox sidebar, then select
    <strong>Toolbox<em>snippet_name</em>|Properties</strong>.</li>

    <li>In the Properties dialog box, click <strong>Change
    Icon</strong>.</li>

    <li>In the Pick an Icon dialog box, select a new icon and click
    <strong>OK</strong>. Alternatively, click <strong>Choose
    Other</strong>, and browse to the desired image file.</li>

    <li>In the Properties dialog box for the snippet, click
    <strong>OK</strong>. The custom icon is displayed next to the
    snippet.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To revert to the default icon for a selected snippet:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In the Toolbox sidebar, right-click the desired
    snippet and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>, then click
    <strong>OK</strong>. The default icon is displayed next to the
    snippet.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="snippets_key_bindings" id=
  "snippets_key_bindings">Snippet Key Bindings</a></h4>

  <p>To assign a key binding to a snippet, right-click the snippet
  on either the <a class="doc" href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>, and
  select <strong>Properties</strong>. Select the <strong>Key
  Bindings</strong> tab, and configure the desired binding. See
  <a href="prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">Key Bindings
  for Custom Components</a> for more information.</p>
