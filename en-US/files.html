  <h1><a name="files_top" id="files_top">Working with
  Files</a></h1>

  <p>Komodo provides a variety of methods for accessing and editing
  files. While files can be opened and edited individually, they
  can also be stored in <a href=
  "project.html#project_top">projects</a> or the
  <a href="toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> as
  components.</p>

  <p>If Komodo is configured to integrate with a <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a> system
  (SCC), status icons beside the filenames indicate the file's
  current SCC status, and SCC options are available from the
  <strong>File</strong> menu and the right-click context menus.
  This integration is described in detail in the Source Code
  Control section of the Komodo documentation.</p>

  <p>Files are manipulated in various ways: via the
  <strong>File</strong> menu, via context menus in the editor, via
  context menus on the file tab (above the editor), and as
  components within projects and the Toolbox.</p>

  <p>This document describes file functionality, such as opening,
  printing, and saving files. See the <a href=
  "editor.html#editor_top">Editing</a> page for
  information about editing files.</p>

  <h2><a name="Creating_a_New_File" id=
  "Creating_a_New_File">Creating Files</a></h2>

  <p>To create a new file, click the "New File" button on the
  standard toolbar. (To display the standard toolbar, click
  <strong>View|Toolbars|Standard</strong>.) A new file with the
  default file extension for the file type is created and opened in
  the Komodo editor. Use the <a class="doc" href=
  "prefs.html#new_files">New Files</a> page in Komodo's
  Preferences to specify the default file extension for new
  files.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_templates" id="files_templates">Creating Files
  from Templates</a></h3>

  <p>New files can be created based on pre-defined templates that
  contain default content for specific file types. See the <a href=
  "templates.html#templates_top">Templates</a>
  documentation for information about configuring custom
  templates.</p>

  <p>To create a new file from a template, select
  <strong>File|New|File</strong>. The New File dialog box contains
  numerous pre-defined templates organized into categories. Select
  the desired category, then select the desired template within
  that category.</p>

  <p>Click <strong>Open</strong> to create a file with the contents
  of the template file. The file is loaded in the editor.</p>

  <p>The <strong>File|New|File</strong> menu displays a list of the
  most recently accessed templates. To alter the number of template
  files displayed, refer to the <a class="doc" href=
  "prefs.html#new_files">New Files</a> page in Komodo's
  Preferences.</p>

  <p>To add a template to the <a href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> for quick
  access, select the desired template and click <strong>Add to
  Toolbox</strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Opening_a_File" id="Opening_a_File">Opening
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>There are numerous methods for opening files in Komodo. These
  include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>File|Open|File</strong>: Open a file using the system
    file browser.</li>
    
    <li><strong>File|Open|Go to File</strong>: Open a file using the
    <strong><a href="#files_go_to_file">Go to File</a></strong>
    dialog.</li>

    <li><strong>Projects or Toolbox sidebars</strong>: Double-click,
    drag and drop, or use the file's right-click context menu to
    open a file contained in a <a href=
    "project.html#project_top">project</a> or the
    <a href="toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Open/Find Toolbar</strong>: Use the <a href=
    "search.html#search_find_toolbar">Open/Find
    Toolbar</a>. To display the Open/Find Toolbar, select
    <strong>View|Toolbars|Open/Find</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Most Recently Used List</strong>: The most recently
    visited files are displayed on Komodo's Start Page. This list is
    also accessible from the <strong>File|Recent Files</strong>
    menu. The number of files in the most recently used list is
    determined by the <a href=
    "prefs.html#UI_Configuration">Appearance</a>
    preference.</li>

    <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Drag and drop one or more
    files from another drag-and-drop application (such as Windows
    Explorer) onto the Komodo editor.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Command-Line Argument</strong>: When Komodo is
    invoked from the command line, files can be specified as open
    arguments. See <a href=
    "starting.html#Windows_Start">Starting on Windows</a>,
    <a href="starting.html#OSX_Start">Starting on OSX</a>, or
    <a href="starting.html#Linux_Start">Starting on Linux</a>
    for more information.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3><a name="files_go_to_file" id="files_go_to_file">Go to File</a> (Fast Open)</h3>
  
  <p>The <strong>Go to File</strong> dialog is an alternative to the system
  native "Open File" dialog. It typically makes it faster to find and open
  files. File names are gathered from a number of sources. A filter box
  allows you to quickly filter this list down to the file you are looking
  for. You can then open an item by pressing 'Enter' or double-clicking
  on the filename. File names sources are (configurable in the "Fast Open"
  preferences panel):</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>currently open files</li>
    <li>files in the current <a href="project.html">project</a> (if any)</li>
    <li>files in the current directories of open files (excluding remote
    directories)</li>
    <li>the last 50 files in <a href="history.html">History</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>File name <em>filtering</em> works as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Words in the filter box are used to match substrings in file basename.</li>
    <li>Matching uses "Smart Case": case-insensitive if the filter words are
    all lowercase, case-sensitive if uppercase letters are used.</li>
    <li>You can also specify full and relative paths in the filter box.
    E.g. "<code>~/myproject/Makefile</code>",
    "<code>../relative/to/current/file.py</code>".</li>
  </ul>

  
  <h3><a name="files_openfindtoolbar" id=
  "files_openfindtoolbar">Opening Files with the Open/Find
  Toolbar</a></h3>

  <p>The <a href=
  "search.html#search_find_toolbar">Open/Find
  Toolbar</a> provides quick access for opening files and finding
  strings. The toolbar is displayed in Komodo by default. To hide
  or show the toolbar, select
  <strong>View|Toolbars|Open/Find</strong>.</p>

  <p>Use the <strong>Open</strong> field on the <strong>Open/Find
  Toolbar</strong> to open one or more files in the filesystem. The
  <strong>Open</strong> field generates a drop-down list of files
  and directories as you navigate the hierarchy. To open a file,
  enter the file path and name, and then press 'Enter'.</p>

  <p>For example, to open a file named "debug.txt" in the directory
  <em>C:\temp\log</em> on a machine running Windows, enter
  <em>C:\tmp\log\debug.txt</em> in the <strong>Open</strong> field
  and then press 'Enter'. As you enter each backslash, a drop-down
  list displays the files and directories beneath the current
  directory.</p>

  <p>Enter "./" or ".\" in the <strong>Open</strong> field to
  display a list of files and directories in the "current"
  directory. The current directory is determined as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Current File</strong>: If a file is open in the
    editor, the directory where the file is stored is the current
    directory. If multiple files are open, the file that is
    currently displayed is the current file.</li>

    <li><strong>HOME Variable</strong>: If no files are open,
    Komodo checks if the system has a defined <code>HOME</code>
    environment variable. If so, the directory specified in that
    variable's value is the current directory.</li>

    <li><strong>Filesystem Root</strong>: If neither of the above
    conditions is met, the system's root directory is used ("C:\"
    is the default on Windows, and "/" is the default on Linux and
    Mac OS X).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To narrow the results in the list box, enter one or more
  characters in the name of the file or directory you wish to open
  or view. (The search is case-sensitive.) Alternatively, use the
  arrow keys to navigate the drop-down list. The contents of the
  <strong>Open</strong> field are updated as you move up and down
  the list with the arrow keys.</p>

  <p>Note that you can use standard directory navigation syntax to
  change directories. For example, if the current directory is
  <em>/home/fred/tmp/foo</em>, change to the
  <em>/home/fred/tmp/bar</em> directory by entering
  <em>../bar</em>.</p>

  <p>To open a file, press 'Enter' when the file name is displayed
  in the <strong>Open</strong> field. To continue navigating the
  directory structure, append a frontslash or backslash to the
  directory name displayed in the <strong>Open</strong> field; the
  drop-down list is updated with the list of files and directories
  that exist under the current location.</p>

  <p>To open multiple files, specify a wildcard ("*" for a file
  name segment, "?" for a specific character). For example, to open
  all the files with the extension ".tcl" in the directory
  <em>/home/fred/tmp</em>, enter <em>/home/fred/tmp/*.tcl</em>.</p>

  <p>At any time, press the 'Escape' key to return focus to the
  Komodo editor.</p>

  <h3><a name="Opening_Remote_Files" id=
  "Opening_Remote_Files">Opening Remote Files</a></h3>

  <p>Komodo can open files located on remote machines, providing
  that the remote machine is configured for FTP, FTPS, SFTP, or SCP
  access. To quickly access frequently used servers, create an
  entry in the <a class="doc" href=
  "prefs.html#Servers">Server Preferences</a>
  (<strong>Edit|Preferences|Servers</strong>).</p>

  <p>To open a file located on a remote server, select
  <strong>File|Open|Remote File</strong>.</p>

  <h4><a name="files_remote_connect" id="files_remote_connect">Connecting
  to a remote server</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-Configured Server Connection</strong>: If
    remote servers have been configured in Komodo's <a class="doc"
    href="prefs.html#Servers">Preferences</a>, select
    the name of the configuration from the <strong>Server</strong>
    drop-down list. Access the Server Configuration dialog box by
    clicking the <strong>Accounts</strong> button to the right of
    the <strong>Server</strong> field.</li>

    <li><strong>Manual Server Connection</strong>: Enter the
    server's fully qualified hostname in the
    <strong>Server</strong> field. Press 'Enter'. You are prompted
    to enter a name and password for the server. If the server is
    configured for anonymous access, select <strong>Anonymous
    login</strong>. To store the login name and password for the
    server, click <strong>Remember these values</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a name="files_public_key_auth" id="files_public_key_auth">Using Public
  Key Authentication</a></h4>
  
  <p>Komodo supports public key authentication through external key agents like
  ssh-agent (inlcuded with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a>
  distribution) and Pageant (a companion utility for <a
  target="_blank" href="http://www.putty.nl/">Putty</a>). This allows you to
  access remote files over SFTP or SCP without entering passwords.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ssh-agent configuration</strong>: See IBM's <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc2/">OpenSSH key management</a>
    guide or the <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent">ssh-agent
    manual page</a>.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Pageant configuration</strong>: See <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.putty.nl/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter9.html#pageant">Using Pageant
    for authentication</a>".</li>
  
  </ul>
  
  <p>Information on configuring public key authentication with source code
  control (CVS and SVN) can be found in <a
  href="scc.html#config_ssh">Configuring SSH Support for CVS and
  Subversion</a>.</p>

  <h4><a name="files_navremote" id="files_navremote">Navigating the
  Remote File System</a></h4>

  <p>After establishing a connection to the remote server, a list
  of files and directories is displayed. These files and
  directories exist under the directory specified in the
  <strong>Look in</strong> field. Double-click a directory
  (indicated by a file folder icon) to navigate the directory
  structure. Use the navigation buttons in the top right corner of
  the dialog box to navigate the remote filesystem.</p>

  <p>To open a single file, double-click the filename. To open
  multiple files, hold down the 'Ctrl' key while clicking multiple
  files, then click <strong>Open</strong>.</p>

  <p>The buttons in the top right corner of the dialog box perform
  various file and directory manipulation functions. Hover your
  mouse pointer over the buttons for a description of their
  functions. To delete or rename a file on the remote server,
  right-click the filename and, with the left mouse button, select
  the desired command on the context menu.</p>

  <h3><a name="Open_Mapped_URI" id="Open_Mapped_URI">Opening Mapped
  URIs</a></h3>

  <p><a href="prefs.html#mapped_uris">Mapped URIs</a>
  can be opened by dragging a mapped link from a browser into
  Komodo. For example, if you mapped the URL
  <em>http://www.example.org/</em> to the local directory
  <em>/var/www/</em>, you could drag a link like
  <em>http://www.example.org/projects/test.html</em> from a browser
  into Komodo, which would open the local file
  <em>/var/www/projects/test.html</em></p>

  <p>This feature also works with URIs mapped to remote filesystems
  (via FTP, SFTP or SCP), which in turn can be configured for
  automatic authentication under <strong><a href=
  "prefs.html#Servers">Edit|Preferences|Servers</a></strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Switching_Between_Files" id=
  "Switching_Between_Files">Switching Between Files</a></h2>

  <p>To switch between open files in the editor:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Key Binding</strong>: Use the associated <a href=
    "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
    binding</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Editor Tabs</strong>: Click the tab with the
    desired filename.</li>

    <li><strong>Window Menu</strong>: On the
    <strong>Window</strong> menu, select <strong>Next File</strong>

  <a href="editor.html#editor_tabs">Editor Tab
  Display</a> in the editor documentation.</p>

  <h2><a name="Comparing_Files" id="Comparing_Files">Comparing
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>Komodo includes a "diff" mechanism used to compare files. To
  compare two files using Komodo's "diff" window:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Tools|Compare Files</strong>.</li>

    <li>By default, the path and file name of the file currently
    displayed in the editor is the first file for comparison. As
    desired, alter this selection by entering an alternate path and
    file, or browse for the desired file using
    <strong>Browse</strong> button. Use the same mechanism to
    specify the second file.</li>

    <li>Click <strong>Compare Files</strong>. The contents of both
    files are displayed in the "diff" window.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If the file is stored in a <a href=
  "project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>, this function
  can also be invoked by right-clicking the file and selecting
  <strong>Compare File With</strong>.</p>

  <p>The unique characteristics of each file are displayed in
  different colors (red and blue by default); common
  characteristics are displayed in a third color (black by
  default). To configure custom colors for the "diff" window, alter
  the <strong>Language-Specific Coloring</strong> setting for the
  <strong>Other|Diff</strong> language in the <a class="doc" href=
  "prefs.html#lang_specific">Fonts and Colors</a>
  preference.</p>

  <p>The following buttons (and default keybindings) are available in
  the "diff" window:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Next</strong> ('F8'): Jump to the next change.</li>
    <li><strong>Previous</strong> ('F7'): Jump to the previous change.</li>
    <li><strong>Reveal</strong> ('F9'): Jump to corresponding line. Opens
    and/or shifts focus to the original file in the Editor Pane. If
    viewing a diff in an editor tab, right-click and select
    <strong>Jump to Corresponding Line</strong> (or select
    <strong>Navigation|Jump to Corresponding Line</strong>) to shift
    focus to the editor tab containing the source code. Selecting
    this option opens the source code tab in the Editor Pane if it
    is not already open and/or shifts focus to the original file in
    the Editor Pane. (If viewing a diff in an editor tab,
    right-click and select <strong>Jump to Corresponding
    Line</strong>.)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>A right-click context menu is also available with the following
  additional options:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Copy</li>
    <li>Select All</li>
    <li>View Whitespace</li>
    <li>View Indentation Guides</li>
    <li>View Line Numbers</li>
    <li>View EOL Markers</li>
    <li>Word Wrap</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <p>Pressing 'Esc' closes the window.</p>
  
  

  <h2><a name="files_refstatus" id="files_refstatus">Refreshing
  File Status</a></h2>

  <p>The <strong>Refresh Status</strong> option checks the
  read/write disk status for the component. If the file is of a
  language for which "code intelligence" is supported and enabled
  (as configured in the <a href=
  "prefs.html#code_intel">Code Intelligence
  Preferences</a>), <strong>Refresh Status</strong> also updates
  the code intelligence database with the contents of the file.</p>

  <p>If the component is stored in a <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">source code control</a> system,
  <strong>Refresh Status</strong> also checks the repository status
  of the file. Komodo determines whether a file is contained in an
  SCC repository by the following methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perforce</strong>: analysis of the client
    configuration</li>

    <li><strong>CVS</strong>: analysis of the CVS control
    directories</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To refresh the file status of the current file, right-click
  the file tab or right-click within the editor and select
  <strong>Refresh Status</strong>. The same option is available on
  the right-click context menu of files in <a href=
  "project.html#project_top">projects</a> or within the
  <a href="toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="files_scc" id="files_scc">Source Code
  Control</a></h2>

  <p>Komodo provides source code control support for files stored
  in CVS or Perforce repositories. Source code control support
  (including SCC configuration, status icons and specific commands)
  is described in detail in the <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">Source Code Control</a> section of
  the documentation. To access source code control commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Editor Context Menu</strong>: Right-click a file in
    the editor and select <strong>Source Control</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>File Tab Context Menu</strong>: Right-click a file
    tab above the editor and select <strong>Source
    Control</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Toolbox or Project Context Menu</strong>:
    Right-click a file in the <a class="doc" href=
    "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> or <a href=
    "project.html#project_top">Projects sidebar</a> and
    select <strong>Source Control</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Toolbox or Project Menu</strong>: If a file is
    currently selected in the <a href=
    "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a> or <a href=
    "project.html#project_top">Projects sidebar</a>, use the
    menu to access source code control commands for the selected
    file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="files_settings" id="files_settings">File Properties
  and Settings</a></h2>

  <p>In addition to the Komodo's global <a href=
  "prefs.html#prefs_top">Preferences</a>, some
  preferences can also be configured on a per-file basis. These
  settings override the global and project level preferences. To
  access the Properties and Settings dialog box for a file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Edit Menu</strong>: On the <strong>Edit</strong>
    menu, click <strong>Current File Settings</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Editor Context Menu</strong>: Right-click in the
    editor and select <strong>Properties and Settings</strong> from
    the context menu.</li>

    <li><strong>File Tab Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the tab
    above the editor that displays the filename, and select
    <strong>Properties and Settings</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="files_settings_props" id="files_settings_props">File
  Properties</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>Properties</strong> category in the Properties and
  Settings dialog box displays general information about the file,
  such as the directory where it is stored, the size and creation
  and modification dates. The following file characteristics can be
  modified on this tab:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Toggle the file's status
    between writable and read-only.</li>

    <li><strong>Language</strong>: This field displays the current
    language association (which affects language-specific options
    like syntax coloring and AutoComplete) for the current file. To
    change the language association, select another language from
    the drop-down list. To set the language association to the
    Komodo default (as configured in the <a href=
    "prefs.html#File_Associations">File Association
    Preference</a>, click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Encoding</strong>: Use this field to set the
    <a href=
    "prefs.html#Internationalization">International
    Encoding</a> for the current file. Select <strong>Use signature
    (BOM)</strong> to use the byte order mark (a Unicode character
    at the top of the file which indicates the encoding) if
    present.</li>

    <li><strong>Line Endings</strong>: Use this field to set the
    desired line endings for the current file. By default, Komodo
    preserves the line endings contained in a file when the file is
    opened. (Default line endings for new files are configured in
    the <a class="doc" href="prefs.html#new_files">New
    Files</a> preference.) If you select <strong>Preserve existing
    line endings</strong>, new lines are assigned the end-of-line
    character selected in the drop-down list, but existing lines
    are not be altered.</li>
  </ul>For HTML and XML documents, two additional settings are
  available:

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Default DOCTYPE</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Default Namespace</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Komodo tries to determine these values from the document's XML
  declaration. If the document does not have one, the DOCTYPE and
  namespace can be manually set here, enabling appropriate XML
  autocompletion. XHTML 1.1 is the default if no declaration or
  settings are present.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_settings_scc" id="files_settings_scc">File
  Source Control Settings</a></h3>

  <p>If Komodo is configured to work in conjunction with a <a href=
  "scc.html#scc_top">Source Code Control</a> system, the
  <strong>Source Code Control</strong> category displays the
  current SCC status and settings.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_settings_editing" id=
  "files_settings_editing">File Editor Settings</a></h3>

  <p>The options on this tab are a subset of the <a href=

  <h3><a name="browser_preview" id="browser_preview">Browser
  Preview</a></h3>

  <p>This option configures the behavior of the <a href=
  "editor.html#browser_preview">Preview in Browser</a>
  function. When the Preview in Browser function is invoked, you
  are prompted to specify the file or URL used to preview the
  current file. (For example, when previewing a CSS file, specify
  an HTML file to use for the preview.) The Preview in Browser
  dialog box has an option for remembering the specification. If
  that option is enabled, the file or URL specified is displayed in
  the <strong>Preview</strong> field. Click <strong>Change</strong>
  to alter the preview file.</p>

  <h2><a name="Printing" id="Printing">Printing Files</a></h2>

  <p>To print the file that is currently displayed in the editor,
  use one of the following methods. These methods invoke the
  standard system dialog box for printer selection and
  configuration. Advanced print functions are described below.</p>

  <h2><a name="Saving_a_File" id="Saving_a_File">Saving
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>Komodo is "intelligent" about saving files. For example,
  Komodo prompts to save unsaved files on close. Attempting to save
  changes to a file that is set to read-only displays a dialog box
  where you are given the option to change the status or to "force"
  the save (which makes the file writable, saves the changes, then
  sets the file back to read-only). In addition, Komodo can be
  configured to automatically save a backup copy of files open in
  the editor. To configure Komodo's save functionality, use the
  <a href="prefs.html#Save_Options">Save Options</a>
  preference page.</p>

  <p>To save a file with its current name, do one of the
  following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Key Binding</strong>: Use the associated <a href=
    "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
    binding</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>File|Save</strong>: Use the
    <strong>File|Save</strong> menu option to save the file that is
    currently displayed in the editor. To save the file to a
    different name, select <strong>File|Save As</strong>. To save
    all open files, select <strong>File|Save All</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Standard Toolbar</strong>: Click the Save button on
    the Standard toolbar. To save all open files, click the Save
    All button.</li>

    <li><strong>File Tab Context Menu</strong>: Right-click the
    file tab and select <strong>Save</strong>. To save the file to
    a different name, select <strong>File|Save As</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="Saving_Files_Remotely" id=
  "Saving_Files_Remotely">Saving Files Remotely</a></h3>

  <p>To save a copy of the current file to a remote server, select
  <strong>File|Save Remotely As</strong>. The <a href=
  "#Opening_Remote_Files">Remote File</a> dialog box is displayed.
  When editing files located on a remote server (including remote
  files stored in a <a href=
  "project.html#project_top">project</a> or the <a href=
  "toolbox.html#toolbox_top">Toolbox</a>), saving the
  file automatically saves it to the remote location.</p>

  <h3><a name="files_showunsaved" id="files_showunsaved">Show
  Unsaved Changes</a></h3>

  <p>Before saving a file, view the changes in the file since it
  was last saved by using the <strong>Show Unsaved Changes</strong>
  option. To invoke this option, right-click within the editor (or
  on the file tab above the editor) and select <strong>Show Unsaved
  Changes</strong>. An external window displays the differences
  between the current version of the file and the disk version
  (e.g., the version that was last saved).</p>

  <p>The unique characteristics of each file are displayed in
  different colors (red and blue by default); common
  characteristics are displayed in a third color (black by
  default). To configure custom colors for the "diff" window, alter
  the <strong>Language-Specific Coloring</strong> setting for the
  <strong>Other|Diff</strong> language in the <a class="doc" href=
  "prefs.html#lang_specific">Fonts and Colors</a>
  preference.</p>

  <h2><a name="Revert_File" id="Revert_File">Reverting
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>To abandon changes made to a file since it was last saved, but
  leave the file open in the editor, select
  <strong>File|Revert</strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Closing_Files" id="Closing_Files">Closing
  Files</a></h2>

  <p>To close one or more files, use one of the following
  methods:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Editor Tabs</strong>: Click the "x" in the top right
    corner of the tab, or middle-click on the tab.</li>
    
    <li><strong>File Menu</strong>: Select <strong>File|Close</strong>
    then one of <strong>Current Tab</strong>,
    <strong>Other Tabs</strong> or <strong>All Tabs</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Key Binding</strong>: Use the associated <a href=
    "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key binding</a> (e.g. "Ctrl"+"F4"
    on Windows).</li>

    tab and select <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
