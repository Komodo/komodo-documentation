<p>Komodo's refactoring facility is designed to make it easier to apply
well-known operations described in refactoring catalogs such as
<a href="http://refactoring.com/">http://refactoring.com/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Supported changes can be accessed via the <strong>Edit|Refactoring</strong>
  menuitem or via the editor context menu <strong>Refactoring</strong>. You can
  also assign command-keys via <strong>Edit|Preferences|Editor|Key Bindings</strong>,
  type "Refactoring:" in the Search box to narrow the hits, and then assign key
  bindings to the selected command.
</p>

 <h2><a name="refactoring_commands" id="refactoring_commands">Refactoring Commands</a></h2>
 <p>This section documents the current supported refactoring commands.</p>
 
 <h3><a name="refactoring_rename_variable" id="refactoring_rename_variable">Rename Variable</a></h3>
 <p>
  This command is similar to doing a <a href="search.html#search_actions">Search &amp; Replace</a>,
  but is aware of the current scope. Additionally, the change is done interactively.  Each
  instance of the specified variable is selected, and then Komodo uses multiple cursors to
  let you change all the instances concurrently.  The edit action ends when the mouse is
  clicked, or a control, alt, or command key is pressed (except backspace), or when
  another window gets the focus. The standard way to end a concurrent edit action
  is by pressing the ESC key.
 </p>
 <p>Codeintel is intended to work as well, with continuations applied to each cursor.</p>
 
 <p>Undo commands should undo all concurrent edits at once.</p>
 
 <p>The Notifications window states how many instances of the target variable
 were found, and gives the range of lines they cover.</p>
 
 <h3><a name="refactoring_extract_method" id="refactoring_extract_method">Extract Method</a></h3>
 
 <p>Select a block of text, invoke the <strong>Extract Method</strong>, provide
 a name of a method to write the text to, and Komodo will do the rest of the
 work, moving the code to a separate method definition before the current one,
 and leaving it selected to allow it to be easily moved.  The location of
 the block is replaced with a call to the extracted method.</p>
 
 <p>This operation is obviously language-dependent, and is currently
 implemented for Python.</p>
 
 <p>This kind of refactoring move is best done in unison with unit
 tests, to validate that the change has introduced no changes in
 the working of the code.  In particular, the code analysis doesn't
 look at loops, and can't predict that the value of a variable set
 in one run through a loop will be used in a subsequent one.  So if
 you extract that kind of code to a method, you need to make sure
 the changed variable is returned from the new method.</p>
 
 <p>Method extraction is undoable in a single step.</p>
