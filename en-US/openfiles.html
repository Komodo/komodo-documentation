  <p>
    The Open Files widget does exactly as the name implies - it lists the
    files that you currently have opened. It also sorts them by name and
    groups them by language. Additionally your files will be split into 2
    different sections when split view is active.
  </p>

  <h2>Switching to Files</h2>

  <p>
    To switch to any of your open files simply click on them in the Open Files
    widget.
  </p>

  <h2>Closing Files</h2>

  <p>
    When hovering over an open files in the Open Files list a close icon ("X")
    will appear at the right of the item. Click this to close the file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally you can close the file by right clicking on the list item, or
    by pressing the relevant keybinding (Editor: Close Current Buffer).
  </p>

  <h2>File Actions</h2>

  <p>
    Upon right clicking a file in the Open Files list you will receive the
    same context menu as when right clicking a tab, allowing you to perform
    actions upon the relevant file.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Bindings</h2>

  <p>
    Open Files adds the following 2 key bindings:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
        User Interface: Focus on Open Files Pane
    </li>
    <li>
        User Interface: Show/Hide Open Files Pane
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To use these key bindings, define them under Preferences > Editor > Key
    Bindings. For more info refer to the <a href="keybind.html">Key Binding
    documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Hiding the Tab Bar</h2>

  <p>
    As Open Files allows you to switch between your files similarly to the tab
    bar you may want to disable the tab bar. To do this simply press View > View
    Editor Tabs.
