  class="version_alert">Komodo IDE only</span></h1>
  
  <p>Publishing lets you take a group of files saved locally, upload
  them to a remote server, then keep the local and remote files in sync.
  Komodo keeps track of the synchronization details to avoid copying
  files that haven't changed and uses advanced conflict detection to
  avoid overwriting changes made by others.</p>
  
  <p>You can also using Publishing for file backups.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="publish_config" id="publish_config">Creating a
  Configuration</a></h2>
  
  <p>To launch the Publishing configuration wizard, click
  <strong>Tools|Publishing|New Configuration</strong>. You will be
  prompted to set up:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong>: A convenient name for your saved
    configuration.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Local path</strong>: The full path to the directory
    containing the files you want to publish. Use the Browse button or
    enter the path manually.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Remote path</strong>: The full URI path to the target
    directory. Use the Browse button to navigate to a <a
    href="prefs.html#Servers">previously configured server</a>, or enter
    the URI manually (e.g.
    <code>scp:///username@servername/path/to/dir</code>)</li>
    
    <li><strong>Includes</strong>: File types to be included in the
    synchronization. Use glob syntax separated by semi-colons (e.g.
    "*.html;*.xml") or leave blank.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Excludes</strong>: File types to be excluded from the
    synchronization. Use either Includes or Excludes, not both. Same
    syntax as above.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Clicking "Save" opens the Synchronization dialog box and initiates
  the first push of the local files to the remote server.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="publish_sync" id="publish_sync">Synchronizing</a></h2>

  <p>The Synchronization dialog box shows which local files will be
  pushed to the server, which remote files will be pulled from the
  server, and which files cannot be synchronized because of a
  conflict. The following actions are available:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Check All</strong>: selects all items in the list.</li>
    <li><strong>Uncheck All: de-selects all items in the list.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Diff Changes</strong>: shows a unified diff of all pending changes (selected files).</li>
    <li><strong>Synchronize</strong>: starts the pending uploads and downloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When synchronizing, Komodo will first examine these locations for
  any file differences and present the changes for your inspection.
  Check the files you wish to be transfered and then triggering the
  synchronize action will copy the files between the local and remote
  file systems. Synchronization operations can be aborted at any time by
  pressing the stop botton.</p>
