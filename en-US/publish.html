  class="version_alert">Komodo IDE only</span></h1>
  
  <p>Publishing synchronizes groups of files between local and remote
  systems over FTP, SFTP, FTPS or SCP. You can upload a group of files
  from your local system or download a group from the remote system
  and keep the synchronized. Local changes are pushed to the remote
  server, and remote changes are pulled to the local system.</p>
  
  <p>Komodo keeps track of the synchronization details to avoid copying
  files that haven't changed and uses advanced conflict detection to
  avoid overwriting changes made by others.</p>
  
  <p>You can use Publishing for deploying websites to the hosting web
  server, or use it with remote storage as a simple backup utility.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="publish_config" id="publish_config">Creating a
  Configuration</a></h2>
  
  <p>To launch the Publishing configuration wizard, click
  <strong>Tools|Publishing|New Configuration</strong>. You will be
  prompted to set up:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong>: A convenient name for your saved
    configuration.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Local path</strong>: The full path to the local
    directory. Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button or enter the path
    manually.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Remote path</strong>: The URI of the remote directory,
    including the hostname and full path. Use the
    <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate to a <a
    href="prefs.html#Servers">previously configured server</a>, or enter
    the URI manually (e.g.
    <code>scp://username@servername/path/to/dir</code>)</li>
    
    <li><strong>Includes</strong>: File types to be included in the
    synchronization. Use glob syntax separated by semi-colons (e.g.
    "*.html;*.xml") or leave blank.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Excludes</strong>: File types to be excluded from the
    synchronization. Same syntax as above. If you use both, the Excludes
    list takes priority if there are conflicts.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Auto-push on file save</strong>: With this option enabled,
    when a local publishing file is saved in the Komodo editor, it will be
    automatically pushed to the remote server location.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Clicking "Save" opens the Synchronization dialog box and shows the
  details of the pending synchronization.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="publish_sync" id="publish_sync">Synchronizing</a></h2>

  <p>The Synchronization dialog box shows:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>which local files will be uploaded to the server</li>
    <li>which remote files will be downloaded from the server</li>
    <li>which files cannot be synchronized because of a conflict</li>
  </ul>
  
  <img src="img/publish_sync.png" alt="Synchronization dialog box" />
  
  <p>The following actions are available:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Check All</strong>: selects all items in the list.</li>
    <li><strong>Uncheck All</strong>: de-selects all items in the list.</li>
    <li><strong>Diff Changes</strong>: shows a unified diff of all pending changes (selected files).</li>
    <li><strong>Synchronize</strong>: starts the pending uploads and downloads.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>When synchronizing, Komodo will examine the local and remote
  locations for any file differences and present the changes for your
  inspection. Check the files you wish to be transferred (or use
  <strong>Check All</strong>). Clicking <strong>Synchronize</strong>
  will copy the files between the local and remote file systems. The
  synchronization be aborted at any time by pressing the
  <strong>Stop</strong> button.</p>

  <h3><a name="publish_conflict" id="publish_conflict">Conflicts</a></h3>
  
  <p>If a file has been modified locally <em>and</em> remotely, the
  conflict will be highlighted in the file list. Right click on any file
  in the file list to bring up a context menu with the following
  options:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Diff</strong>: Show the line-by-line differences between the files.</li>
    <li><strong>Resolve conflict</strong>: Lets you choose one file or the other -
    <strong>Upload the local file</strong> or <strong>Download the
    remote file</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="publish_commands" id="publish_commands">Publishing Commands</a></h3>
  
  <p>There are also the following publishing commands available on
  a per-file basis (through the Places or the editor tab context menus):</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Push</strong>: Pushes the locally changed file to the remote server.</li>
    <li><strong>Diff</strong>: Shows the line-by-line differences between the local and remote file.</li>
  </ul>
