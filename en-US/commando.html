  <h1><a name="commando_top">Commando (Go To Anything)</a></h1>
    <p>
        Commando is a primarily keyboard driven panel that can be accessed by
        pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+O</code> on Windows and Linux or
        <code>Cmd+Shift+O</code> on Mac. You can also access it from your
        toolbar by clicking the "Go To Anything" search field. It allows you to
        easily access various parts of Komodo and your development workflow
        without disrupting your thought process.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="scopes">Scopes</h2>
    
    <p>
        A "scope" defines what you are searching for. By default you search for
        items in all available scopes. Note that some scopes (such as the Shell
        scope) are excluded from this "Search Everything" behaviour due to their
        results being too disruptive when used out of context.
    </p>
    
    <p>You can select a scope in various ways:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Select the relevant scope from the results when invoking Commando</li>
    
        <li>Click on the scope icon to the left of your search field</li>
    
        <li>Define a shortcut for your scope in your
            <a href="prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key bindings</a>, then use this
            shortcut to open Commando with your scope already selected.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2 id="searching">Searching</h2>
    
    <p>
        To search, simply invoke Commando and start typing your search query.
        Scopes are designed to handle your query intelligently, in most cases
        you can simply type partial matches for your search query, which do not
        even need to be in order. For example I could search for <code>filename
        .txt mypath</code> and it would match
        <code>/path/to/<strong>mypath</strong>/folder/<strong>filename</strong>_1<strong>.txt</strong></code>.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="selecting-results">Selecting Results</h2>
    
    <p>You can select results in various ways:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Select them by using your keyboard arrow keys and pressing enter<br>
    
            <ul>
                <li>You can select multiple results by holding shift</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li>Press the associated ALT+Number shortcut</li>
    
        <li>Double click on them with your mouse</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3 id="expanding-results">Expanding Results</h3>
    
    <p>
        You can also "expand" some results. Expanding a result gives you the
        option to perform contextual actions on them, such as marking them as a
        Favourite. To do this simply highlight a result and press the right
        arrow key.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="entering-subscopes">Entering Subscopes</h3>
    
    <p>
        A subscope is a scope within a scope. For example when searching for
        files you can select a folder to view its contents. The folder is a
        subscope. To enter a subscope you simply select the result.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Once in a subscope you can navigate back to the previous scope or subscope
        by pressing Backspace or Escape.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="clearing-the-cache">Clearing the Cache</h3>
    
    <p>
        Some of the Commando scope keep a cache of results. Although these are
        designed to update when necessary it is possible that a cache becomes
        out of sync. You can clear the cache manually by pressing the icon to
        the left of the search field and selecting "Clear Cache".
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="preferences">Preferences</h3>
    
    <p>You can alter some of Commando's behaviour under <a href="prefs.html#prefs_top">Preferences</a>.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Max Results</strong> - this allows you to limit the number
        of results shown at any given time, lowering this may improve
        performance on slower systems, at the cost of less results.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Search Delay</strong> - defines how long after typing
        Commando should start searching. Increasing this may improve performance
        on slower systems, at the cost of slower results.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Result Render Delay</strong> - defines how long Commando
        should wait before rendering results, allowing it to combine DOM writes.
        Increasing this may improve performance on slower systems, at the cost
        of slower results.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Peserve Previous Search Query</strong> - When enabled
        Commando will return to your last search query when you reopen it.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Relative paths use the current file's directory</strong> -
        When searching using relative paths this will use the currently opened
        file as the path to search relative from. When unchecked your Project /
        Places path is used.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Default Shell Output</strong> - Defines where to output
        shell commands where relevant.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="everything-scope">Everything Scope</h2>
    
    <p>
        The "Everything" scope allows you to, as the name implies, search for
        everything. Ironically it does exclude one scope; the Shell scope. This
        is done because the shell scope results are very disruptive when
        accessed out of context.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="bookmarks-scope">Bookmarks Scope</h2>
    
    <p>
        The bookmarks scope allows you to easily navigate to
        <a href="editor.html#bookmarks">bookmarks</a> within the current file.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="commands-scope">Commands Scope</h2>
    
    <p>
        The commands scope allows you to access all of Komodo's registered
        commands. Basically anything that you can add a keybinding for you can
        access from this scope.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="files-scope">Files Scope</h2>
    
    <p>
        The files scope allows you to search for files within your currently
        selected project or working directory. Commando uses the directory
        defined in your Project preferences or otherwise falls back to the
        directory selected in your <a href="places.html#places_top">Places
        pane</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="searching-1">Searching</h3>
    
    <p>The file scope allows for some advanced Search functionality;</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You can search relative to the current file by typing a relative
        path as your search query</li>
    
        <li>You can search using an absolute path simply by typing an absolute
        path as your search query</li>
    
        <li>When searching using a relative or absolute path you can search
        recursively by adding a space between the path and your search query. If
        no space is present then the tail end of the path will be used as your
        search query for a non-recursive search.</li>
    
        <li>You can use created shortcuts (including <a
        href="https://code.google.com/p/go-tool/">go tool</a> shortcuts) by
        typing your shortcut name and a trailing slash</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="open-files-scope">Open Files Scope</h2>
    
    <p>
        As the name implies this scope will allow you to quickly access your
        opened files. It's a convenient alternative to the Open Files pane and
        your editor tabs.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="sections-scope">Sections Scope</h2>
    
    <p>
        The sections scope allows you to quickly access your file symbols. It
        allows you to navigate to classes, functions within files or nodes
        within XML/HTML files.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
    
    <p>The tools scope gives easy access to your <a href="toolbox.html#toolbox_top">toolbox</a>.</p>
    
    <h2 id="tools-commands">Tools &amp; Commands</h2>
    
    <p>The Tools &amp; Commands scope combined the the Tools &amp; Commands scopes.</p>
