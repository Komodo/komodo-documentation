  <h1><a name="feedback_top" id="feedback_top">Sending
  Feedback</a></h1>

  <p> We're interested to hear what you think of Komodo, and welcome
  your feedback, suggestions, bug reports and feature requests.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="Feedback">Comments and Feedback</a></h2>
  
  <p>If you would like to tell us how Komodo met or didn't meet your
  coding needs, send us an email at: <a
  href="mailto:komodo-feedback@activestate.com">komodo-feedback@activestate.com</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>To share your feedback with the Komodo community, post to one of
  the Komodo forums on the ActiveState Community website:</p>

  <h2><a name="Reporting_Bugs" id="Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h2>

  <p>If you have found a bug, we'd like to know about it. First, query
  our on-line bug database to see if your bug has already been
  reported:</p>
  
  <a target="_blank"
  href="http://bugs.activestate.com/query.cgi">
  http://bugs.activestate.com/query.cgi</a>
  
  <p>Try a few searches using different keywords related to the
  problem; someone else may have reported the same problem, but
  described it slightly differently. If you can't find an existing
  bug, submit a new one. A set of guidelines for writing up a bug can
  be found here:</p>
  
  <a target="_blank"
  href="http://bugs.activestate.com/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html">
  http://bugs.activestate.com/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html</a>
  
  <p>New bugs can be submitted here:</p>
  
  <a target="_blank"
  href="http://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi">
  http://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi</a>
  
  <p>Your bug will be assigned a bug ID (and related URL) that you can
  use to monitor the progress of the bug. The system can also email
  you when your bug is resolved.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="Requesting_Features" id=
  "Requesting_Features">Feature Requests</a></h2>

  <p>If you tried Komodo and you would like to see a specific feature
  or enhancement, provide a detailed description in a <a
  target="_blank" href="http://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi">
  bug report</a> with Severity set to "7-enhancement".</p>
