<h1><a name="support_feedback_top" id="support_feedback_top">Support and
Feedback</a></h1>

<p>There are a number of ways to get help if you run into problems using
Komodo.</p>

<h2><a name="support_docs" id="support_docs">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>Have a look through this user guide to see if there is any relevant
documentation. Use the Search field in the top right corner of the
Komodo Help window to search the table of contents.</p>

<h2><a name="support_community" id="support_community">ActiveState
Community Site</a></h2>

<p>Komodo developers monitor the <a target="_blank"

Support forum</a> for issues. You can search the site to see if other
users have encountered a similar problem.</p>

<p>The site also hosts <a

<h2><a name="support_bugs" id="support_bugs">Reporting Bugs</a></h2>

  <p>If you have found a bug, we'd like to know about it. First, query
  our on-line bug database to see if your bug has already been
  reported:</p>
  
  <a target="_blank"
  href="http://bugs.activestate.com/query.cgi">
  http://bugs.activestate.com/query.cgi</a>
  
  <p>Try a few searches using different keywords related to the
  problem; someone else may have reported the same problem, but
  described it slightly differently. If you can't find an existing
  bug, submit a new one. A set of guidelines for writing up a bug can
  be found here:</p>
  
  <a target="_blank"
  href="http://bugs.activestate.com/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html">
  http://bugs.activestate.com/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html</a>
  
  <p>New bugs can be submitted here:</p>
  
  <a target="_blank"
  href="http://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi">
  http://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi</a>
  
  <p>Your bug will be assigned a bug ID (and related URL) that you can
  use to monitor the progress of the bug. The system can also email
  you when your bug is resolved.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="support_feature_req" id=
  "support_feature_req">Feature Requests</a></h2>

  <p>If you tried Komodo and you would like to see a specific feature
  or enhancement, provide a detailed description in a <a
  target="_blank" href="http://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi">
  bug report</a> with Severity set to "7-enhancement".</p>

<h2><a name="support_email" id="support_email">ActiveState Technical Support</a></h2>

<p>If the problem you are having is not referenced in any of the
resources above, or if the posted solutions do not work for you, Komodo
IDE users can get technical support by sending an email to <a
href="mailto:support@activestate.com">support@activestate.com</a>.
Include as much information as possible about the problem you are
having and the software you are running, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the version of Komodo (copy the Build Information listed in
  "Help|About Komodo").</li>
  <li>your operating system version</li>
  <li>relevant details of any associated software you are running (e.g.
  PHP version, SCC type, filesystem type)</li>
</ul>
