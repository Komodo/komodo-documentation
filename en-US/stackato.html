  <h1><a name="stackato_top" id="stackato_top">Stackato</a> <span class=
  "version_alert">Komodo IDE only</span></h1>

  <p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/cloud">Stackato</a> is a cloud
  application platform which is based on, and fully compatible with,
  <a href="http://cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry</a>. Stackato sets up
  virtual servers and deploys applications to them, automatically
  provisioning everything your application requires to run (language
  interpreter, web framework, modules, databases, and other services). </p>
  
  Komodo works in conjunction with the Stackato client to provide an
  interface to Stackato and Cloud Foundry-based services. More
  information on stackato can be found at: <a
  href="http://www.activestate.com/cloud">www.activestate.com/cloud</a>

  <h2><a name="stackato_client_setup" id="stackato_client_setup">Stackato Client Setup</a></h2>
  
<p>To enable Stackato support in Komodo:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a
    href="http://community.activestate.com/stackato/download">Download
    the client</a></li>
    
    <li>Rename and/or <code>chmod</code> the file as necessary (see <a
    href="http://docs.stackato.com/quick-start.html#stackato-client-setup">Stackato
    Client Setup</a>)</li>
    
    <li>Set the location of the client under
    <strong>Preferences|Stackato</strong></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Once the client is installed and configured, the
  <strong>Tools|Stackato</strong> interface will be usable.</p>
  
  <h2><a name="stackato_connecting" id="stackato_connecting">Connecting to Stackato</a></h2>

  <p>To connect to a Stackato API endpoint (e.g.
  'https://api.stackato.local') enter the URL in the
  <strong>Target</strong> field and click <strong>Target</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: By default, Stackato servers
  will accept connections only over HTTPS.</p>
  
  <p>Once the API endpoint is targeted, enter the username (an email
  address) and password, then click <strong>Login...</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a name="stackato_info" id="stackato_info">Viewing Target Info</a></h3>

  <p>Details of the targeted Stackato system can be seen using the
  buttons under the User field:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Show Target Info: Shows the server and client versions, and the
    usage quotas for the logged-in user.</li>
    <li>Show Runtimes: Lists the available language runtimes.</li>
    <li>Show Frameworks: Lists the supported frameworks.</li>
    <li>Show Services: Shows which services are available (and lists provisioned services).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The Applications pane shows applications belonging to the current
  user that have been deployed to the target. It shows their current status, the
  number of instances running, what services are bound to each, and the
  application URL(s).</p>
  
  <p>The Provisioned Services pane (collapsible) shows the services that have been
  provisioned for the current user, whether or not they are bound to
  applications.</p>
  
  <p>The Stackato Output pane (collapsible) show the console output of
  the various Stackato commands as they run.</p>
  
  <h2><a id="creating_applications"></a>Creating Applications</h2>
  
  <p>New applications can be created by either right-clicking on an empty row in
  the Applications table and selecting "Add...", or pressing the "Add a new app"
  button in the toolbar above the Applications table (it's the one with the
  blue right-pointing arrow). This will bring up the
  <strong>New Stackato App Wizard</strong>, where you can set the properties on
  the application. Most of the properties should be straightforward:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Application Name</dt><dd>The name of the application. This should
    consist of only letters and digits, as the URL the form suggests is
    generated from the name. However the URL can be edited. Once it's edited,
    changing the application name no longer modifies the suggested URL.</dd>
    
    <dt>Path</dt><dd>The path to the root folder containing the application to
    push.</dd>
    
    <dt>URL</dt><dd>The URL of the application.</dd>
    
  </dl>
  <p>The remaining options, except <a
  href="#debugging_applications">debugging</a>,
  should be straightforward. Note that on the next step of the wizard,
  you are given an opportunity to bind a service to the new application.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Selecting <strong>No</strong> moves the wizard to the final
    confirmation page.
    <li>Selecting <strong>Use an existing provisioned service</strong> moves
    the wizard to the service-selection page.
    <li>Selecting <strong>Define a new provisioned service</strong> moves
    the wizard to the service-definition page. When a service is added
    on that page, the next move will go to the service-selection page.
  </ul>
  
  <h2><a id="debugging_applications"></a>Debugging Applications</h2>
  
  <p>Stackato (versions 1.26 and higher) supports debugging of Rails, Sinatra,
  Django, and PHP applications remotely via Komodo. These applications can be
  debugged remotely in Komodo by checking the <strong>Debug App</strong> box
  on the first page of the <strong>New Application</strong> wizard, and filling
  in the host Komodo is running on, and the port it's watching. Normally
  Komodo can figure out what these values should be, but if you have a
  different scenario in mind, such as creating the Stackato app on one
  machine, but debugging it from another, you'll need to adjust these fields
  accordingly.
  </p>
  
  <p>You can also switch an app into debug or non-debug mode by right-clicking
  its row in the main table, and pressing the <strong>Configure Debugger...</strong>
  menu item. This brings up a small dialog box which you can check the <strong>Debug
  Application</strong> and modify the host and/or port Komodo will listen on
  for debugging sessions. As with the application description wizard, the
  interface will get the port number from Komodo, but may not be able to determine
  the hostname. This is because the hostname field should contain the name or
  IP address the debugging machine is known to the Stackato VM.</p>
  
  <p>Note that changing an application's debugging settings will cause the
  Stackato client to restage it, which might cause a delay on some systems.</p>
  
  <p>Each type of app is debugged in a slightly different way:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Debugging PHP Stackato applications is no different from
    debugging other PHP programs remotely. Simply put
    <strong>XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1</strong> at the end of the address bar,
    prepending it with a "?" if it's the only parameter, or a "&" if there are
    others. You can end debugging by either pressing Komodo's
    <strong>Detach</strong> button, or with the URL parameter
    <strong>XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP=1</strong>.</li>
    
    <li>Rails, Sinatra, and Django applications are debugged by appending a
    <strong>STACKATO_DEBUG=1</strong> parameter to a request URI in the address
    bar, prepending it with either "?" or "&" similar to triggering a
    debugger session with PHP. In this case, once you start debugging an
    application, the application will remain in debug mode until it's restarted.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For all supported languages, debugging sessions work better if
  the preference <strong>Debugger | Debugger/Editor Integration |
  Try to find files on the local system when remote debugging</strong>
  is checked. If you make changes to locally found files while debugging,
  you can save your changes and push the changes to the server.
