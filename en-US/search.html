  <p>Komodo provides a variety of methods for searching and
  replacing text, both within files open in the editor and within
  files on the filesystem. While Komodo has standard search and
  replace functionality, it also features unique search mechanisms
  like searching for the work under the cursor, incremental
  searching and function search.</p>

  <h2><a name="search_strings" id="search_strings">Searching for
  Strings</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="Finding_a_word" id="Finding_a_word">Searching Within
  Open Files: Find Dialog</a></h3>

  <p>The Find dialog box is used to search for words or phrases in
  the current document. To open the Find dialog box, from the
  <strong>Edit</strong> menu, select <strong>Find</strong>, or use
  the associated <a href=
  "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key binding</a>.</p>

  <p>Enter the text you wish to find in the <strong>Find
  what</strong> field.</p>

  <p>The following search options can be configured:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Match Case</strong>: To find matches of the search
    string regardless of case, select <strong>No</strong>. To find
    matches only when the search string matches the case of the
    occurrence, select <strong>Yes</strong>. To find exact case
    matches only when the search string contains mixed case, select
    <strong>Yes, if search string contains capital
    letters</strong>. For example, if you enter "mystring" in the
    <strong>Find what</strong> field and select <strong>Yes, if
    search string contains capital letters</strong>, both
    "mystring" and "myString" will match. However, if you enter
    "myString" in the <strong>Find what</strong> field, only
    "myString" will match.</li>

    <li><strong>Use</strong>: Choose <strong>Plain Text</strong> to
    exactly match the search string. <strong><a href=
    "regex-intro.html#regex-intro_top">Regular
    Expressions</a></strong> will interpret the search string as a
    <a href=
    "regex-intro.html#python_regex_syntax">Python
    regular expression</a>, and perform the search accordingly;
    <strong>Wildcards</strong> will interpret asterisk and question
    mark characters as glob-style wildcards. The option specified
    (Plain Text, Regular Expressions (Python), Wildcards) becomes
    the default search type used for the <a href=
    "#editor_find_toolbar">Open/Find Toolbar</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Match whole word</strong>: If this box is checked,
    matches in the document will only be found if whitespace occurs
    on either side of the search string. For example, if the search
    string is "edit" and "Match whole word" is selected, only
    occurrences of the word "edit" will be found as matches.
    However, if "Match whole word" is not selected, "editing",
    "editor", "editorial" and "edited" will also be found as
    matches.</li>

    <li><strong>Search up</strong>: This performs the search from
    the cursor position to the top of the file, rather than from
    the cursor position to the bottom of the file. (The default
    functionality is to search down from the cursor position.)</li>

    <li><strong>Display results in Find Results 2</strong>: Komodo
    supports two <strong>Find Results</strong> tabs in the <a href=
    "workspace.html#Output_Pane">Bottom Pane</a>. Check
    this box to display the search results in the second, rather
    than the first, <strong>Find Results</strong> tab. If this box
    is not checked, the first <strong>Find Results</strong> tab is
    used to display the results of the search.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <a href="#editor_find_toolbar">Open/Find</a> toolbar uses
  the settings from the <a href="#find_in_files">Find in Files</a>
  and <a href="#Finding_a_word">Find</a> dialog boxes as default
  search parameters. For example, if you configure the
  <strong>Find</strong> dialog box to search using wildcards, the
  <strong>Open/Find</strong> toolbar will also perform wildcard
  searches.</p>

  <p>Specify where Komodo should search for the text. In the
  "Search in" section, select one of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Current document</strong>: This searches the
    document that is currently in focus in the editor for
    occurrences of the search string.</li>

    <li><strong>Selection only</strong>: will only search the
    highlighted area of the document that is in focus in the
    editor. (If you search a selected section, the highlighting of
    the selected section will be temporarily turned off in order to
    display highlighted results of the Find function.)</li>

    <li><strong>All open documents</strong>: Search for the string
    in all documents currently open in the editor.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Invoke the search by clicking the desired search command
  button:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Find Next</strong>: Finds consecutive occurrences
    of the search string in your file or selection. As matches are
    found, the text will be highlighted. The Find dialog box
    remains in focus. To keep the focus in your file, close the
    Find dialog box, then use the associated <a href=
    "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
    binding</a>.</li>

    <li><strong>Find All</strong>: Locates all occurrences of the
    search string in your file or selection. The matches will be
    displayed in the <a href="#Find_Results">Find Results</a> tab
    in the Bottom Pane.</li>

    <li><strong>Mark All</strong>: Inserts a <a href=
    "editor.html#bookmarks">bookmark</a> on each line
    that contains the search string. To move the editing cursor to
    a bookmarked line, press <strong>F2</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To display the results of a previous search, click the
  relevant <strong>Find Results</strong> tab in the Bottom Pane. If
  the Bottom Pane is not displayed, select <strong>View|Tabs|Find
  Results</strong>.</p>

  <h3><a name="Searching_and_replacing" id=
  "Searching_and_replacing">Replacing Within Open Files: Replace
  Dialog</a></h3>

  <p>The Replace dialog box is used to search for and replace words
  or phrases in the current document. To open the Replace dialog
  box, from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, select
  <strong>Replace</strong>, or use the associated <a href=
  "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key binding</a>.</p>

  <p>Enter what to find and replace with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Find what</strong>: Enter the search string you
    want to find.</li>

    <li><strong>Replace with</strong>: Enter the replacement
    characters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following replace options can be configured:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Match Case</strong>: To find matches of the search
    string regardless of case, select <strong>Never</strong>. To
    find matches only when the search string matches the case of
    the occurrence, select <strong>Always</strong>. To find exact
    case matches only when the search string contains upper-case
    letters, select "If Search String Contains Capital Letters".
    For example, if you enter "function" in the <strong>Find
    what</strong> field and select "If Search String Contains
    Capital Letters", both "function" and "Function" will match.
    However, if you enter "Function" in the <strong>Find
    what</strong> field, only "Function" will match.</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Use</strong>:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plain Text</strong>: Match the exact search
        string.</li>

        <li><strong>Regular Expressions</strong> Interprets the
        search string as a Python <a href=
        "regex-intro.html">regular expression</a>.
        Expressions and strings can be enclosed in parentheses to
        retain the matched substring for use in the <strong>Replace
        with</strong> field. Use the "\<em>num</em>" syntax to
        insert the results of the match into the replacement (i.e.
        "\1" for the first "(...)" group, "\2" for the second
        group, etc.).</li>

        <li><strong>Wildcards</strong> Interprets the asterisk and
        question mark characters as wildcards for simple "glob"
        matching.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Match whole word</strong>: If this box is checked,
    matches in the document will only be found if whitespace occurs
    on either side of the search string. For example, if the search
    string is "edit" and "Match whole word" is selected, only
    occurrences of the word "edit" will be found as matches.
    However, if "Match whole word" is not selected, "editing",
    "editor", "editorial" and "edited" will also be found as
    matches.</li>

    <li><strong>Search up</strong>: Performs the search from the
    cursor position to the top of the file, rather than from the
    cursor position to the bottom of the file.</li>

    <li><strong>Show "Replace All" Results</strong>: Displays the
    number of replacements in the status bar at the bottom left of
    the Komodo Workspace. Details of each change, complete with the
    line number, will appear on the <strong><a class="doc" href=
    "#Find_Results">Find Results</a></strong> tab in the Bottom
    Pane.</li>

    <li><strong>Display in Find Results 2</strong>: Komodo supports
    two <strong><a class="doc" href="#Find_Results">Find
    Results</a></strong> tabs in the Bottom Pane. Check this box to
    display the search results in the second, rather than the
    first, <strong>Find Results</strong> tab. If this box is not
    checked, the first <strong>Find Results</strong> tab is used to
    display the results of the search.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Specify where Komodo should replace the specified text. In the
  "Replace in" section, select one of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Current document</strong>: Searches the document
    that is currently in focus in the editor for occurrences of the
    search string.</li>

    <li><strong>Selection only</strong>: Only searches the
    highlighted area of the document that is in focus in the
    editor. (If you search a selected section, the highlighting of
    the selected section will be temporarily turned off in order to
    display highlighted results of the Find function.)</li>

    <li><strong>All open documents</strong>: Searches for the
    string in all documents currently open in the editor.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Invoke the search by clicking the desired search command
  button:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Find Next</strong>: Finds consecutive occurrences
    of the search string in your file or selection. As matches are
    found, the text is highlighted. Click <strong>Replace</strong>
    to replace the highlighted text with the replacement
    string.</li>

    <li><strong>Replace</strong>: Highlights the next occurrence of
    the search string; if you click <strong>Replace</strong> again,
    the highlighted text will be replaced with the replacement
    string and the next occurrence of the search string will be
    highlighted.</li>

    <li><strong>Replace All</strong>: Replaces all occurrences of
    the search string in the document or selection without
    prompting for confirmation. All replacements will be displayed
    on the <a class="doc" href="#Find_Results">Find Results</a> tab
    of the <a class="doc" href=
    "workspace.html#Output_Pane">Bottom Pane</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="word_under_cursor" id="word_under_cursor">Searching
  for the Word Under the Cursor</a></h3>

  <p>When the editing cursor is within (or adjacent to) a word, you
  can quickly search for other occurrences of the same word within
  the current document. If you are using the default <a href=
  "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key binding</a>
  scheme, press 'Ctrl'+'F3' to select the word; continue pressing
  'Ctrl'+'F3' to step through each occurrence in the document.
  ('Meta'+'F3' for Mac OS X users.)</p>

  <h3><a name="incr_search" id="incr_search">Incremental
  Search</a></h3>

  <p>Incremental search is used to look through the current file in
  the Editor Pane for a group of incrementing characters. That is,
  as you continue to type in search characters, Komodo will find
  the next occurrence of the search string. After all the search
  characters have been entered, you can move through each
  occurrence of the search string within the current file.</p>

  <p><strong>To start an incremental search</strong> select
  <strong>Edit|Incremental Search</strong>, or use the associated
  <a href="prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
  binding</a>. (If you are using the default key binding scheme,
  the key binding is 'Ctrl'+'I' on Windows and Linux and 'Meta'+'I'
  on Mac OS X.) The status bar (in the bottom left corner of the
  Komodo workspace) will display the text "Incremental Search:".
  Begin typing the characters you want to find; as you type
  characters, the editing cursor will move to the first match
  beneath the current cursor position within the current file, and
  the search string will be displayed in the status bar.</p>

  <p><strong>To change the search string</strong> based on the
  characters surrounding the editing cursor, use the associated
  <a href="prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
  binding</a>. If the default <a href=
  "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key binding</a>
  scheme is in effect, the key combination is 'Shift'+'Right Arrow'
  (to add one or more characters to the right of the editing
  cursor) or 'Shift'+'Left Arrow' (to remove one or more characters
  to the left of the editing cursor). On Mac OS X the key bindings
  are 'Meta'+'Right Arrow' and 'Meta'+'Left Arrow'.</p>

  <p>For example, if you entered "fo" as the search string, and the
  next occurrence of these characters was in the word "foo", you
  could use the 'Shift'+'Right Arrow' key combination to extend the
  search string to "foo". Conversely, you could use the
  'Shift'+'Left Arrow' key combination to reduce the search string
  to "f".</p>

  <p><strong>To search through the file for the search
  string</strong> press 'Ctrl'+'I' to find subsequent occurrences
  of the search string within the current file (On Mac OS X, press
  'Meta'+'I'). Continue pressing 'Ctrl'+'I' to cycle through all
  occurrences. When the search reaches the bottom of the file, it
  will continue from the top of the file. 'Ctrl'+'Shift'+'I' will
  search backwards from the current cursor positon (On Mac OS X,
  press 'Meta'+'Shift'+'I').</p>

  <p><strong>To cancel the incremental search</strong> press any
  key except the key bindings assigned to the incremental search
  functions.</p>

  <h3><a name="find_in_files" id="find_in_files">Searching All
  Files: Find in Files Dialog</a></h3>

  <p>The Find in Files dialog box complements the <a href=
  "#Finding_a_word">Find</a> dialog box by providing the ability to
  search for text in files that are not currently opened in Komodo.
  Select <strong>Edit|Find in Files</strong> (or use the associated
  <a href="prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key
  binding</a>) to open the new dialog box.</p>

  <p>The Find in Files dialog box consists of the following
  options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Find what</strong>: Enter the search string.</li>

    <li><strong>Match Case</strong>: To find matches of the search
    string regardless of case, select <strong>No</strong>. To find
    matches only when the search string matches the case of the
    occurrence, select <strong>Yes</strong>. To find exact case
    matches only when the search string contains mixed case, select
    <strong>Yes, if search string contains capital
    letters</strong>. For example, if you enter "mystring" in the
    <strong>Find what</strong> field and select <strong>Yes, if
    search string contains capital letters</strong>, both
    "mystring" and "myString" will match. However, if you enter
    "myString" in the <strong>Find what</strong> field, only
    "myString" will match.</li>

    <li><strong>Match whole word</strong>: If this box is checked,
    matches in the document will only be found if whitespace occurs
    on either side of the search string. For example, if the search
    string is "edit" and "Match whole word" is selected, only
    occurrences of the word "edit" will be found as matches.
    However, if "Match whole word" is not selected, "editing",
    "editor", "editorial" and "edited" will also be found as
    matches.</li>

    <li><strong>Use</strong>: Choose <code>Plain Text</code> to
    exactly match the search string. <strong>Regular
    Expressions</strong> will interpret the search string as a
    Python regular expression and perform the search accordingly;
    <strong>Wildcards</strong> interpret asterisk and question mark
    characters as wildcards.</li>

    <li><strong>Search in</strong>: By default, the <strong>Search
    in</strong> field is populated with a period, which indicates
    that the "current" directory will be searched. (If no file is
    open, the current directory is the value specified in the
    <code>HOME</code> environment variable; if the
    <code>HOME</code> variable is not defined, the current
    directory is "C:\" on Windows and "/" on OS X and Linux. If one
    or more files are open, the location of the file that is
    displayed in the Editor Pane is the current directory.) To
    search directories other than the current, either specify an
    absolute path, or specify a relative path from the current
    directory. For example, if the current directory is
    <em>/home/fred/tmp/foo</em>, you could search the
    <em>/home/fred/tmp/bar</em> directory by entering
    <em>../bar</em>. Manually enter one or more directories;
    multiple directories are separated by semicolons.
    Alternatively, click the browse button to the right of the
    field to display a directory browser dialog box. (Directories
    already specified in the <strong>Search in</strong> field will
    be displayed in this dialog box.) Use the directory browser to
    navigate the filesystem, specify one or more search
    directories, and/or alter the order in which the directories
    are searched.</li>

    <li><strong>Search in subfolders</strong>: If this box is
    checked, subdirectories beneath the directories specified in
    the <strong>Search in</strong> field are also searched.</li>

    <li><strong>Include</strong>: To specify one or more file types
    that should be searched, enter the file extensions preceded by
    a wildcard. For example, to search files with ".pl" and ".tcl"
    extensions, enter <code>*.pl;*.tcl</code>. (Note that multiple
    file extensions are separated by any combination of semicolons,
    spaces, colons, and commas.)</li>

    <li><strong>Exclude</strong>: To specify one or more file types
    that should be excluded from the search, enter the file
    extensions preceded by a wildcard. For example, to exclude
    files with ".exe" and ".doc" extensions, enter
    <code>*.exe;*.doc</code>. (Note that multiple file extensions
    are separated by any combination of semicolons, spaces, colons,
    and commas.) If both the <strong>Include</strong> and
    <strong>Exclude</strong> fields are blank, all file types are
    searched.</li>

    <li><strong>Display results in Find Results 2</strong>: Komodo
    supports two <strong><a class="doc" href="#Find_Results">Find
    Results</a></strong> tabs in the Bottom Pane. Select this check
    box to display the search results in the second, rather than
    the first, <strong>Find Results</strong> tab. If this box is
    not checked, the first <strong>Find Results</strong> tab is
    used to display the results of the search.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After clicking <strong>Find All</strong>, the <strong>Find
  Results 1</strong> or <strong>Find Results 2</strong> tab
  (depending on the setting of the <strong>Display results in Find
  Results 2</strong> check box) are displayed in Bottom Pane.
  Depending on the number of files that are being searched, it may
  take some time to generate results. (The search status is
  displayed on the top line of the <strong>Find Results</strong>
  tab. The results include the file in which the search string is
  found, the line number in the file where the search string
  occurs, and the context surrounding the search string.
  Double-click a search result (or click the arrow button at the
  top right of the pane) to open the file in the editor and place
  the editing cursor on the selected occurrence.</p>

  <h3><a name="editor_find_toolbar" id="editor_find_toolbar">Fast
  Search: Open/Find Toolbar</a></h3>

  <p>The <a href="workspace.html#Toolbars">Open/Find</a>
  toolbar provides quick access for opening files and finding
  strings. Find strings in files currently displayed in the editor
  or in files not currently open in Komodo but located on the
  filesystem. The toolbar is displayed by default; to close or open
  the toolbar, select <strong>View|Toolbars|Open/Find</strong>.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Open/Find</strong> toolbar also provides fast
  access to find functionality. The <strong>Find</strong> and
  <strong>in</strong> fields are used to perform searches on files
  in Komodo or elsewhere in the filesystem. Both fields have a list
  of the most recently entered strings and file specifications. Use
  the <strong>in</strong> field browse button, located to the right
  of the <strong>in</strong> field, to populate this field with the
  directory, folders, or files you want to search.</p>

  <p>Enter the string that you wish to search in the
  <strong>Find</strong> field. The <strong>Find</strong> toolbar
  uses the settings from the <a href="#find_in_files">Find in
  Files</a> and <a href="#Finding_a_word">Find</a> dialog boxes as
  default search parameters. For example, if you configure the
  <strong>Find</strong> dialog box to search using wildcards, the
  <strong>Find</strong> toolbar will also perform wildcard
  searches.</p>

  <p>Specify the files that should be searched in the
  <strong>in</strong> field. The <strong>in</strong> field uses the
  same logic as the <strong>Open</strong> field to determine the
  current directory. (If no file is open, the current directory is
  the value specified in the <code>HOME</code> environment
  variable; if the <code>HOME</code> variable is not defined, the
  current directory is "C:\" on Windows and "/" on OS X and Linux.
  If one or more files are open, the location of the file that is
  displayed in the Editor Pane is the current directory.)</p>

  <p>To search directories other than the current, either specify
  an absolute path, or specify a relative path from the current
  directory. For example, if the current directory is
  <em>/home/fred/tmp/foo</em>, you could search the
  <em>/home/fred/tmp/bar</em> directory by entering
  <em>../bar</em>. Alternatively, use the <strong>in</strong> field
  browse button to locate and populate this field with the
  directory, folders, or files you want to search.</p>

  <p>The <strong>in</strong> field accepts wildcards; use "*" for a
  file name segment and "?" for a specific character. Separate
  multiple directories with semicolons. If nothing is specified in
  the <strong>in</strong> field, the search will be performed
  against the file that is currently displayed in the Editor Pane
  (if applicable), and the next occurrence of the search string is
  highlighted.</p>

  <p>For example, to search for occurrences of the string "error"
  in all files located in the directory <em>/tmp/output</em>, enter
  <strong>error</strong> in the <strong>Find</strong> field and
  <strong>/tmp/output/*</strong> in the <strong>in</strong>
  field.</p>

  <p>If files are specified in the <strong>in</strong> field,
  matches will be displayed in the <a name="find_results" id=
  "find_results"><strong>Find Results tab</strong></a>.</p>

  <p>At any time, press the <strong>Escape</strong> key to return
  focus to the Komodo editor. The <strong>Find</strong> field can
  be accessed via the associated <a href=
  "prefs.html#Config_Key_Bindings">key binding</a>.</p>

  <p>For example, to search for occurrences of the string "debug"
  in all files located in the directory <em>/tmp/log</em> on a
  machine running Linux, enter <strong>debug</strong> in the
  <strong>Find</strong> field. Enter <strong>/tmp/log/*</strong> in
  the <strong>in</strong> field, or use the "browse" button to
  locate this directory on your filesystem. For more information on
  searching using the <strong>Open/Find Toolbar</strong>, see
  <a class="doc" href="#editor_find_toolbar">Finding
  Strings</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="Find_Results" id="Find_Results">Find Results
  Tabs</a></h3>

  <p>The <strong>Find Results 1</strong> tab (located in the
  <a href="workspace.html#Output_Pane">Bottom Pane</a>)
  displays all matches that result when the <strong>Find
  All</strong> function in the Find dialog box is used. The Find
  Results 1 tab displays the line number on which the match
  occurred and the line that contains the match. Double-click a
  line in the Find Results tab to display the line in the Editor
  Pane.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Find All</strong> function in the <a class="doc"
  href="#Finding_a_word">Find</a> and <a class="doc" href=
  "#Searching_and_replacing">Replace</a> dialog box, and the
  <a class="doc" href="#find_in_files">Find in Files</a> dialog box
  (<strong>Edit|Find in Files</strong>) both make use of the
  <strong>Find Results</strong> tab, which displays the result of
  the search on the Command Output tab. Komodo includes a second
  output tab that can be specified by checking the <strong>Display
  results in Find Results 2</strong> check box. By using both tabs,
  search results are not overwritten every time a new search is
  invoked.</p>

  <h2><a name="functions" id="functions">Finding Functions:
  Function Search</a></h2>

  <p>The Function Search looks through the current document for the
  following constructs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Perl programs</strong>: <code>sub</code> and
    <code>package</code> statements.</li>

    <li><strong>Python programs</strong>: <code>class</code> and
    <code>def</code> statements.</li>

    <li><strong>PHP programs</strong>: <code>class</code> and
    <code>function</code> statements.</li>

    <li><strong>Ruby programs</strong>: <code>module</code>,
    <code>class</code> and <code>def</code> statements.</li>

    <li><strong>Tcl programs</strong>: <code>proc</code>
    statements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="search_movefunc" id="search_movefunc">Moving Between
  Functions</a></h3>
