  <h2 id="collab_account">Account Setup</h2>
  
  <p>Before you can use <a href="sync.html">Sync</a> or Collaboration,
  you have to set up your ActiveState account in Komodo. If you do not
  have one, you can create one for free at: <a
  href="https://account.activestate.com/signup/">https://account.activestate.com/signup/</a>
  </p>

  <p>To set up the account, select <strong>Tools &gt; Komodo Services &gt; My
  Account</strong> from the menu. Enter the email address and password
  of your ActiveState account and click <strong>Login</strong>. If your
  login data was valid, you should see the message "You're logged in to
  Komodo Services".</p>

  <h2 id="collab_collab">Collaboration Overview</h2>

  <p>With Collaboration you can edit documents in Komodo with several
  people at the same time. Changes are transmitted in near real-time,
  similar to other tools like Google Docs. All content that you create
  with Komodo Collaboration is stored on the ActiveState Collaboration
  server until you delete it. Though the Collaboration content is not
  encrypted, only your authorized Contacts will be able to see and edit
  it.</p>

  <h3 id="collab_usage">Using Collaboration</h3>

  <p>Open the <strong>Collaboration</strong> tab in the left sidebar and
  click the <strong>Enable Komodo Collaboration</strong> button.</p>

  <p>When collaboration is enabled and connected to the server, the
  Collaboration tab on the left sidebar displays two different lists:
  <strong>Sessions</strong> and <strong>Contacts</strong>.</p>

  <h4 id="collab_sessions">Sessions</h4>
  
  <p>A collaboration session is a collection of hosted documents that
  you can edit with other people. Click the plus icon in the top right
  corner of the Collaboration tab to create your first session. After
  you have given the session a name, it will appear in your Sessions
  list. New sessions are created without any documents.</p>

  <p>To add a new document, right-click on the session name and select
  <strong>Add &gt; Empty Document</strong> from the context menu. After
  you have given the document a name it appears under its session in the
  Sessions list. Double-click on the document to open it.</p>
  
  <p>To share an existing file, open it in Komodo then right-click on
  the document tab and selecting <strong>Collaboration &gt;
  Share</strong>.</p>
  
  <h4 id="collab_contacts">Contacts</h4>

  <p>Contacts are other Komodo users that you can add to a collaboration
  session, giving them access to all documents within that session.</p>
  
  <p>To add a contact, click the plus icon in the top right corner
  of the <strong>Contacts</strong> pane and enter their email address.
  Use an email address has been <a href="#collab_account">registered
  with ActiveState</a>. The contact will not appear in
  your list immediately; the new contact will receive a
  notification in the bottom right corner of their Komodo window that
  asks them to confirm you as their collaboration contact. Once they
  have confirmed you as their Contact they will appear in your Contacts
  list, and you can add them to your session by right clicking on the
  session name and selecting <strong>Add &gt; User to this Session &gt;
  (Their name)</strong>. Your session will then appear in their
  <strong>Sessions</strong> list and you can start editing documents
  together.</p>
  
  <h3 id="collab_editing">Collaborative Editing</h3>

  <p>Editing text in a collaboration tab generally works the same as
  with any other document, but there are a couple of important
  differences.</p>

  <p>Each tab belonging to a collaboration session has a small green circle icon
  in its tab header. This icon indicates that a connection to the collaboration
  server has been established, and it turns red if an error occurs (i.e.
  if you lose the connection to the server).</p>

  <p>You will also notice some colored highlights in Collaboration documents that you
  won't see in normal Komodo documents: All the text you write will be highlighted
  with a light-blue background. This distinguishes your changes from the original
  text as well as being distinguishable from the modifications made by other
  users, which will have a light-green background. Green and red margins on the
  side help you keep track of the lines that have had text modifications - a green
  margin indicates text was added, whilst a red margin indicates text was removed.</p>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Undo</strong> and
  <strong>Redo</strong> buttons behave differently in a collaboration
  session. You can not undo any changes that have been made by other
  users, and your undo history is discarded whenever another user makes a
  change to the document.</p>
