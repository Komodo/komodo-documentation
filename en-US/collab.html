  <h2 id="collab_collab">Collaboration</h2>
  <p>With Komodo Collaboration you can collaboratively edit documents inside
  Komodo with several people at the same time. All changes are transmitted in
  near real-time, just as you know it from other tools like Google Docs. All
  content that you create with Komodo Collaboration is stored on the ActiveState
  Collaboration server until you delete it. Note that the Collaboration content
  is not encrypted. Only your authorized Contacts will be able to see and edit
  it.</p>

  <h2 id="collab_account">Account Setup</h2>
  
  <p>Before you can start using <a href="collab.html">Collaboration</a>, you
  have to set up your ActiveState account in Komodo. If you do not have one, you
  can create one for free at: <a
  href="https://account.activestate.com/signup/">https://account.activestate.com/signup/</a>
  </p>

  <p>To set up the account, select <strong>Tools|Komodo Services|My
  Account</strong> from the menu. Enter the email address and password
  of your ActiveState account and click <strong>Login</strong>. If your
  login data was valid, you should see the message "You're logged in to
  Komodo Services".</p>

  <h3 id="collab_setup">Collaboration Setup</h3>
  <p>You can now open the <strong>Collaboration</strong> tab in the left sidebar and
  click the <strong>Enable Komodo Collaboration</strong> button.</p>

  <h3 id="collab_usage">Using Collaboration</h3>
  <p>When Collaboration is enabled and connected to the server, the Collaboration tab
  on the left sidebar displays two different lists: Sessions and Contacts.</p>
  
  <p>A Collaboration Session is a collection of hosted documents that you can
  collaboratively edit with other people. Click the plus icon in the top right
  corner of the Collaboration tab to create your first session. After you have
  given the session a name, it should appear in your Sessions list.</p>

  <p>Initially, your session will not contain any documents, so to start
  collaborating, just add a document by right-clicking on the session name and
  selecting <strong>Add &gt; Empty Document</strong> from the context menu. After you have given the
  document a name it appears under its session in the Sessions list. Double-click
  on the document to open it. You can also share an existing file by opening it in
  Komodo and then right-clicking on the document tab and selecting
  <strong>Collaboration-&gt;Share</strong>.</p>

  <p>Contacts are other users that you can add to a Session to give them access to
  all documents within that session. Add your first contact by clicking the plus
  icon in the top right corner of the Contacts panel and entering the email
  address of the person you would like to collaborate with. Note that the email
  address has to be registered with the ActiveState.com account server. The
  contact will not appear in your list instantly. Instead, the person you have
  added will receive a notification in the bottom right corner of their Komodo
  window that asks them to confirm you as their Collaboration Contact. Once they
  have confirmed you as their Contact they will appear in your Contacts list, and
  you can add them to your session by right clicking on the session name and
  selecting <strong>Add &gt; User to this Session &gt; (Their name)</strong>. Your Session will then
  appear in their Sessions list and you can start editing documents together at
  the same time.</p>
  
  <h3 id="collab_editing">Collaborative Editing</h3>

  <p>Editing text in a Komodo Collaboration tab generally works the same as with any
  other document. However, there are a couple of differences that you should know.</p>

  <p>Each tab that belongs to a Collaboration document has a small green circle icon
  in its tab header. This icon indicates that a connection to the Collaboration
  server has been established, and it turns red if an error occurs (if you lose
  the connection to the server).</p>

  <p>You will also notice some colored highlights in Collaboration documents that you
  won't see in normal Komodo documents: All the text you write will be highlighted
  with a light-blue background. This distinguishes your changes from the original
  text as well as being distinguishable from the modifications made by other
  users, which will have a light-green background. Green and red margins on the
  side help you keep track of the lines that have had text modifications - a green
  margin indicates text was added, whilst a red margin indicates text was removed.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the behaviour of the undo and redo buttons is slightly different
  than you might expect it: You can never undo any changes that have been made by
  other users. That means your undo history is discarded whenever another user
  makes a change to the document.</p>
