- solution for deployment of mk
- ask on blog/mozplanet for how (if at all) firefox docs translations are
  coordinated
- breadcrumbs to all files
- kill 'class="doc"' on everything (it *is* a style in aspn.css)
- flavorification:
    - install notes ("installing the Komodo license")
- links:
    - fix linkcheck (does it check toc.xml?)
    - add a target for checking for unused files (imgs, css, etc)
    - check/update links in Komodo sources into help (also the installers)
- feedback page should be updated for openkomodo (its own bugdb),
  use the forums instead of komodo-feedback@activestate.com
- put mk and komododoc in openkomodo tree
- integrate with Komodo build somehow
- regular builds up
- better css placement (drop the "ASPN" css thing?)
- make it skinnable via a styles/$name/{css|img} tree
- check:manifest (check for missing files, non-existant files)
- Either *drop* the text versions of some of the HTML files (e.g.
  RELNOTES.txt) or find a way to produce them via the build. Personally I
  don't think they have enough value. --TM
- the linux "supported oses" are waay out of date
- mv preprocess.py to google code and use externals from there
